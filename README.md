# ACMProjectsAutomation
Scripts to help automate certain parts of the ACM Projects process. Currently, there is a script to find rejected emails.

## How to use the rejected_email_func script
1. Download the sheets that contain all the project applications, the team sheet, and the podmate sheet (all should have an email listed)
2. Navigate to the directory with the sheets and download the reject_email_func.py file within the directory
3. Open your terminal and run the following
```
python reject_email_func.py [name_of_all_applicants_sheet] [team_sheet] [podmates_sheet]
```

BAM! You get a list of all the rejection emails! :0
