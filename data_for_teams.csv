The project went very smoothly but I think it was on the easier side to begin with.

I'm excited to work with students from different fields to get a well-rounded view of how AI can be applied in the real world. Overall, being part of ACM Projects is a key step in reaching my career goals in AI, where I can blend technical skills with ethical considerations and teamwork.","In my previous internship before enrolling at UCSD, I had embarked on a large project over the summer. The project was related to creating a breadboard fluidic system as well as its associated hardware/software, and I additionally had to work with various scientists, optics experts, software engineers, and hardware technicians to continue to communicate with them the various deadlines and requirements that we needed. During this time in the company, a startup, there were a few new people added to the team, as well as contractors who were very intelligent but could only be in for select hours during weekdays. Additionally, I had just started working on another project related to school, and so I was unable to be in the office at moments during the morning. I think I did an extremely effective job, as I feel I was the driving force to enabling communication between all these teams, and essentially led the project in a sense due to every other expert being preoccupied with more specified work. Not only did this allow me to be independent within my role but allowed me to master the art of scheduling via various tools, as well as taking detailed notes and improving my communication so that deadlines were met, and concerns were raised even when there were complications with scheduling. ","When recently joining the TritonAI Autonomous Racing Lab at UCSD, I was surprised by just how passionate the students were about the task at hand. The code was sophisticated. and built upon many libraries with a system already in place. The group continues to try to migrate portions of their software onto a framework called ROS2 for robotics. ROS2 allows you to customize hardware components into various nodes, define data pipelines, and get real-time actions and responses from various sub-components within a machine to complete complex tasks. While there is a strong amount of promise for this technology, as well as intent to move in this direction, I had to learn all of this seemingly on my own, and through reading lots of documentation as well as consulting online resources, I was able to get a strong concept of the basics. I was then able to move into a more intro-level task, replicating a project done earlier by the group in order to gain a basic understanding of the workflow of associated tasks. Now, I work on the drivers for our OAK-D Camera and 3D Lidar and am working on building behavioral cloning to integrate data from these sensors and infer all within the ROS2 framework. ","I'm passionate about AI and have a strong skill set in this area, but I'm also versatile in software engineering, teamwork, and leadership. I'm eager to explore and excel in a variety of roles beyond just AI 

In addition to the skills outlined in my resume, I bring a unique blend of technical abilities that can be valuable for a variety of projects. My experience in the TritonAI Autonomous Racing Research Lab has equipped me with a solid foundation in machine learning and computer vision, particularly in developing Convolutional Neural Networks for real-time image processing. This work has honed my skills in TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, enabling me to tackle complex challenges in perception and object detection. We have made open-source contributions to DonkeyCar to integrate Depth data into their current Keras Model API. Outside of the technical side, I work hard to gain sponsorships to the club via weekly meetings and created outreach templates.

Furthermore, my internship at GenNext Technologies provided me with hands-on experience in software development for high-speed data acquisition and control systems, enhancing my proficiency in C++ and C#. I have also gained practical knowledge in UI design and multi-threaded programming, which can be applied to improve user interfaces and system performance in various applications.

I have always considered myself to be an intelligent and hard-working individual and have lots of experience working within teams. I have always been applauded at my various internships at clubs and have leadership experience outside of technology. In high school, I was the founder and president of the One of a Kindness Campaign, as well as a board member at various clubs. I also learned the ins and outs of team problem-solving through my enrollment in varsity sports.

The Seq2Seq project involved creating a machine translation system using a PyTorch Transformer. I designed an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms, which allowed the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sentence during translation. This resulted in a 90% improvement in translation efficiency from French to English. This project deepened my understanding of natural language processing and the importance of attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models.

In parallel, I worked on the minGrad project, a tiny scalar-value autograd engine built with PyTorch. This project involved implementing a topological sort for backpropagation over a scalar directed acyclic graph, which is fundamental for understanding deep learning and neural networks. I also incorporated custom classes for neurons, layers, and multilayer perceptrons, and visualized the network using the Graphviz API. This project enhanced my grasp of the underlying mechanics of neural network training and the implementation of custom autograd systems.

Together, these projects not only allowed me to apply theoretical concepts in practical settings but also helped me gain a more nuanced understanding of machine learning algorithms and their applications in AI.",I am a team-oriented individual who is passionate about technology and is excited to make a difference!,UX Designer,Visual Designer,User Researcher,Yes,I'm not sure,20,"I want to participate in ACM Design projects because they offer a unique opportunity to blend creativity with technology.

","I've been on multiple teams throughout high school that involved scheduling problems. As president of the Key Club, I had to manage many community service events and our weekly meetings which sometimes had scheduling conflicts. I believe I did an effective job by working with my other officers to figure out the best times for events. One example of this was our beach cleanups, where we strategized what time would be most likely for people to show up to the event, but it wouldn't coincide with other events that clubs at our school were hosting. By working with others, we were able to pick the best time and have a huge turnout at our beach cleanup. ","One example of when I figured something out on my own involved learning Blender. Over the winter break, I decided to try and learn Blender in order to work on game development, which is something I would like to do part-time in the future. One thing I didn't know at the time was how complicated Blender's UI is (there are probably more than 100 different buttons on just the main screen). As I began to try and make my first model, I realized how hard Blender really was, and decided to turn to the internet. I searched up simple Blender YouTube tutorials and landed on the infamous donut tutorial by the Blender Guru. After following each and every tutorial in the series, and making tons of mistakes along the way, I finally finished the donut and felt proud of the completed work. Since then, I have been pretty confident in working my way around Blender, and can't wait to make more models.","Overall, I would say I'm still a beginner when it comes to programming and computer science in general. However, I am eager to learn more in any way I can. For example, over the winter break, I taught myself HTML and CSS to make a website with some of my friends.

I have some experience with web development such as flask, MySQL and javascript, so I wish to be more comfortable with the background scripts of a website by increasing my exposure to these languages and learning new things such as R and MondoDB and new concepts like vectors. A project where we do some actual calculations with the user's data (such as a recommendation algorithm or personality type identifier/matchmaking) would be most preferable.","I was president of our school's tech club during my last 2 years of school. Our main role in the school was to organize tech-related competitions - both intra- and inter-school. Our annual inter-school event was by far our main event with over 30 schools participating every year. 

Team members had to make online registration forms, submissions forms, databasing received information, and coordinate with teacher in-charges, competing students, and judges of different schools in case of technical issues. As the president, I had the extra responsibility of keeping the team on track, being (usually) the first one who was reached out to by anyone facing technical difficulties and planning and hosting the live events. 

We went about solving problems by breaking them into different parts and assigning those parts to different groups. This not only allowed tasks to be completed parallel and hence faster, but also strengthen team unity, making all parts work in sync. Since a lot of us knew coding, we also automated some tasks that were easy to fall behind on such as databasing registrations and checking in on them manually just to verify. ","I learnt flash CS3 animation almost completely on my own. My cousin had introduced me to pivot animation but after playing around with it for a while, I wanted something more capable. Searching around for a while on the internet, I stumbled upon flash CS3. It was totally different from Pivot animation and I was lost for the first two days. 

However, after about a week of playing around, I at least understood the UI (at the time, the most complex computing I had done was messing with game config files through youtube tutorials to make them more optimized for my slow laptop). Still, I could not animate anything on it yet consistently - I would get it to work only half the time. That is finally when I turned to the internet for troubleshooting and learnt about setting 'keyframes', which I had not noticed so far. Finally getting the animation to run consistently, I regained my motivation. I knew how the UI worked, but now I started exploring the menus (the bar you have at the top). One-by-one, with some help of the internet, I learnt about objects, audio effects, layering, lighting, speed and how to use different shapes and structures to make things I actually needed (like racecars or a jug of milk).","For my final project in 12th grade, I made a sleeptracker using python nad MySQL.

They would enter their number of hours slept every night and the quality of their sleep on a scale of 1-10. Users could check their report which told them based on their average number of hours of sleep if they were undersleeping, oversleeping or sleeping a healthy amount according to their age.

","For my current ENG100DR class, my team and I came across many scheduling problems that we needed to fix as our project consisted of us collaborating 2x a week in order to complete this project.  

During this project, I believe I did effective job working around scheduling problems for several reasons. One of the ways I did an effective job was taking advantage of online collaboration tools like when2meet which helped establish what days and times everyone was available. After getting everyone's times, I helped to choose a day and time where we are all able to meet as a team. This helped us to stay organized every week making sure everyone was on board. 

Another way I contributed effectively to solving these scheduling problems was by utilizing a recording software. In our group of 8 team members, coordinating schedules was a challenge due to everyone's different availability. In this case, I proposed a solution where my team and I would utilize the OBS recording software to record our meetings. This helped us to efficiently capture the discussions during our zoom calls, making sure that those unable to attend could stay updated by receiving the recordings. This approach facilitated better communication within our team and also helped workflow by accommodating everyone's different schedules. ","When using Figma for the very first time I was extremely confused. I was absolutely overwhelmed but intrigued with the amount of things you could possibly do with this software. I've seen designs where people have made incredible websites all from Figma and I was determined to use it effectively. 

I really wasn't sure where to start so I just started to experiment with all of the features and eventually after a couple of weeks of getting more comfortable with this software, I decided to start my own challenge where I would start a 30 day design challenge, designing a new and different webpage everyday starting from easy to more complex. After I started to understand all of the features that I was using. After learning all of the basics of Figma, I dove into YouTube tutorials where I essentially self taught myself more complex features, like animations, components and even the design process. With this self taught process, I was finally able to apply these skills to real life projects that I still use today!  ","For my current class ENG100DR, I played a role in project that was aimed at revolutionizing the way healthcare is delivered in the South Pacific. My project was focused on designing and implementing an Electronic Medical Record System (EMR) tailored to rural developing countries. My role was project lead as well as UX designer where I helped set goals and deadlines in designing and implementing the EMR system. Like the question above, this is where I was able to utilize software tools like Figma and Sketch for wireframes and prototyping making sure that the final product met the specific needs of medical professionals.

I played the role of a Planetary Leader or Technical Operations Manager as I also helped to build their website using a website template builder that they had already subscribed to. One of the ways that I did an effective job in this environment was by being flexible with those with a more rigid schedule and leading the tutors to take responsibility for themselves as well. I also mediated more than 150 situations through emails from parents and students alike and encouraged ten or more tutors at a time to continue to tutor over the pandemic through digital encouragement and organized schedules. In order to do a better job, I could have tried to figure out how to automate scheduling processes to streamline the process of assigning tutors to reduce the manual effort in coordinating schedules.","I always wanted to learn and understand how computers and games worked, and before I hit middle school, my dad had some books lying around about Python and JavaScript That’s when I started my programming journey, and from there, I have learned either how to utilize different libraries such as the various python libraries to display GUI interfaces, colors, or represent data, as well as diving into different fields of computer science such as game development with Unity and C# for a few years. Mentors are important in helping to guide students, but I believe that being able to learn on one’s own is a valuable skill to have in life, especially after college. One of the specific ways that I can clearly remember from my time programming, was when I was working on a small game in Unity that I was making, and I was trying to figure out how to fix one of the bugs I was experiencing with Unity’s physics engine for 2D rigidbodies. I then turned to Google to help me fix the bug, but the AI LLMs like ChatGPT were not as developed at the time, and so the immediate solution was not available to me, but understanding the mechanics of how it worked helped me to problem-solve and I ended up fixing the bug after taking the time to understand it. This experience and many others that I have had problem-solving have made me become more passionate about the art of computers and have solidified my desire to make it into a career, even if I am not earning as much as people used to right out of college.","Although I have never developed a full-stack development project before, I have always wanted to collaborate with a team of multiple people in order to do so. I have made some small coding projects in the past before such as small games in Unity or mini-projects in Python or even finishing all coding-bat problems in Python to name a few, but I would like to apply my knowledge to a development team which I believe could be beneficial for my experience. I would say that my aptitude for learning and understanding the logic behind computers has helped me solve issues with software and hardware I have used in the past as I have built my own PC, I have explored a lot of areas of computers like 3D modeling, game development, digital art, music production, some algorithms, and more.","Lucas Hlaing, Davis Kil",AI,Hack,Design,8-10,4,"I want to participate in the ACM AI Projects because I would like to broaden my understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning through a professional program such as ACM AI Projects  which would be perfect for what my future academic and career goals are.

I believe that because we have such a rapidly changing world, we must also learn how to integrate our society with this new technology. I am also considering teaching computer science as a potential career path, and if so, I would like to assist future generations in seeing artificial intelligence as a tool with plentiful useful applications which could have benefits outweighing any risks or costs. But as with any technological advancement, the philosophy, ethics, and potential downfalls must be considered when developing machine learning and its algorithms. Taking this course would help me improve my understanding of artificial intelligence in these ways, and it could also help me to one day advance the field to better integrate with society and impact the daily lives of humans directly to help the world with its many problems.","As being relatively new to AI and its potential, I am looking forward to hands-on introductions to AI that will provide me with a valuable learning experience through exploration. Some AI-related projects that I am interested in working on could possibly be an AI Chatbot that might deal with preprocessing data, building a conversational model, and potentially integrating it into a user-friendly interface, or maybe image classification that will deal with backpropagation with well structured data that can help to train the AI. I would even be interested in potentially making an AI recommendation system or predictive analytics that can take a set of parameters to maybe predict something like the price of housing based on a set of factors which might even be helpful for my roommate and I for finding properties to live as upperclassmen.

While my time on the Marketing Team for TEDxUCSD has introduced me to working with two other team members on Instagram posts and business cards, I would love for the chance to work on a singular design project with a clear goal. That being said, I know that working in a collaborative setting will allow me to see from more varied perspectives, broadening my horizons as a designer. I expect to learn the fundamentals of group design work, as we start on a project from start to finish. ","As I am currently in the i4x Basement Program, where students work in groups partnered up with local companies, I understand the struggle of scheduling. While initially we made when2meets for every week, it was convoluted and a struggle for us to work in a systematic manner. When I noticed this conflict, I called everyone together, and we talked out what days and hours worked best for us - talking face to face helped us designate a weekly meeting time that worked for everyone. From then on, we decided to work on Saturdays from 10 to 11 - sometimes a group member or two can't make it, so we take detailed notes so they can catch up and understand the deliverables we worked on. ","I learned a lot about the basics of Figma through playing around on the application myself - I am someone who enjoys learning by doing, as I find that I retain information better that way. What is nice about this approach is that I end up learning Figma ""easter eggs"" because I'll search for something oddly specific, unlike following an Intro to Figma video, which wouldn't have shown me that easter egg. I've found that Google and ChatGPT are my best friends when it comes to learning niche things for design. ","In the realm of design, I have professional experience in Canva, Figma, and Procreate - skills I mainly sharpened through my role managing marketing operations for Bobaholic, an online Amazon drink store. I was in charge of wireframing the website, creating visually appealing Instagram posts, designing Amazon product pictures, collaborating with influencers for promotions, and shooting product photography. The past two quarters, I have been working on redesigning the TREND Magazine Website, and producing digital content for TEDxUCSanDiego (using Figma and Canvas religiously). In addition, my summer scholarship at Kode with Klossy taught me fundamental skills in inclusive UIUX design, especially when developing user-friendly websites. There, I collaborated with two other students to create a multimedia website from scratch using C++, HTML, and Javascript. Moreover, my role as the Head Writer in my high school's Student Film Association taught me how to synthesize diverse ideas, fostering stories rich in perspective.

This includes honing my ability to empathize with users, understand their needs and preferences, and incorporate their feedback into the design process. Additionally, I am keen on expanding my expertise in research, particularly in conducting comprehensive user research to gain insights that inform design decisions effectively. Moreover, I am eager to further develop my skills in teamwork, including collaboration, communication, conflict resolution, and problem solving. I hope to learn from a diverse team, as it offers a rich opportunity to broaden my perspectives. I aim to effectively contribute to the team, navigate group dynamics, and leverage collective strengths to achieve goals. Strengthening my group work skills will not only allow me to perform well within ACM Projects but also prepare me for success in future collaborative endeavors within the field of design and beyond. ACM projects provides a platform that allows me to apply my knowledge in a practical setting establishing a foundation for projects later on. 
","Last quarter, as a BEI (Brain Exercise Initiative) board member, we encountered scheduling conflicts for our weekly board meetings. All board members were not available at the same time. To address this, we adapted a solution where we held two shorter meetings (30 mins)  each week instead of a single longer meeting (1 hour). This approach allowed all board members to participate in at least one of the meetings, ensuring everyone stayed informed and involved in the decision-making process. By implementing such a structure to accommodate varying schedules, we maintained communication and collaboration within the board despite the scheduling constraints.
 Reflecting on this now, I believe we came up with an effective solution. However, this could have been improved by establishing alternate meeting formats and a clear channel for communication so that information is not missed maximizing the little time we had together. While we successfully navigated these challenges, there is always room for improvement in optimizing team efficiency and effectiveness.
","I recently embarked on a journey to learn 3d design. Without prior experience or guidance, I took the initiative to explore this realm of design and hopefully add it to my list of strengths. I began by breaking down the learning process into smaller, manageable tasks. Initially, I focused on understanding the basic principles of physics relevant to 3D design, next moving on to 3D geometry and Euclidean geometry, essential for creating and manipulating three-dimensional objects in virtual space. Simultaneously, I researched different 3D design technologies and tools to determine the most suitable starting point. Considering my preference for starting small and gradually progressing to more complex programs, I opted for simpler software like Womp that offers intuitive interfaces and basic functionalities. As I gain proficiency with these simpler tools, I plan to transition to more advanced programs such as Blender to further expand my skills and capabilities. By breaking down the learning process into smaller tasks and points, I gained clarity on where to focus my efforts effectively. This self-directed approach enables me to make significant progress in learning 3D design independently, allowing me to explore new technologies and tools with confidence and autonomy.","In addition to my familiarity with user targeted design, I bring a diverse set of abilities to the table. While I've just begun fully immersing myself in the world of design, I've made significant strides in learning tools like Figma and putting my theoretical knowledge of user research into practice. Moreover, my familiarity with Python, HTML, and CSS adds depth to my skill set. This enables seamless collaboration with those possessing a more technical background. By bridging the gap between design and development, I can ensure that our designs are not only visually appealing but also technically feasible. 
Furthermore, my experience in positions such as events intern at KSDT radio station, Programming chair at Muir Residential Council, and Co-chair at Muir Community Garden, have given me ample experience in program creation and event coordination. I believe skills from here transfer well into the design world with understanding people’s needs and preferences and working in teams. 
I'm driven, adaptable, and committed to continuous learning and growth. I believe my blend of design experience, technical understanding, and practical experience positions me well for projects that require a holistic approach to problem-solving and collaboration across disciplines.

This project was due near finals, so I think one issue I had was that I was studying a lot and would have my phone on do not disturb for long periods of time. I think that this made communication for plans within the group more difficult and something I can improve in the future by more actively checking my messages.","Recently, I have been learning to use Vim. I took interest in it because I kept hearing about it on social media platforms and quickly learned that there was a large divide between people who prefer editors like VSCode to editors like Vim. Before this point, I had only used Vim once or twice because my professor mentioned it in CSE 30, but I didn't understand it and switched to nano for simplicity. 

I decided to code one of my CSE 100R PAs using Vim to try to understand it, and now I am in love with it. I didn't have any help as this was something that I decided to do unprompted, which meant it took a lot of work. I was fumbling around for a while and the PA probably took much longer than it would have otherwise, but by the end I felt I had made some good progress. I still have a lot to learn, but getting the basic Vim motions down opened my eyes to the realm of possibility of amazing productivity so I am excited to keep using it and getting better.","Not listed on my resume, I have taken online courses from freecodecamp for both HTML/CSS and JavaScript so I am familiar with building basic websites and manipulating elements. 

My biggest strength is my enthusiasm for programming. I have maintained a 4.0 in all my CSE related classes, mostly because I enjoy them the most. When I have a choice between doing calc homework, writing an essay, or coding an entire project, I gravitate very heavily towards the coding just because it feels so fun to code when I am in the zone. ",,AI,Hack,,10+,5,"I want to participate for 2 main reasons. Firstly, I would really like to learn more about AI. Obviously, AI is the ""big thing"" right now with chatGPT and Devin and all of these projects that have come out in the past couple of years, but it really is something that I have genuine interest in. I remember watching a Youtube video of OpenAI vs. OG (a Dota 2 professional team), where the AI completely smoked the pros. After that game, the Dota community learned from the AI's strategies, and the game evolved. Just like when you are learning a sport you copy the pros, in this case people were copying the AI and finding new ways to win. This was the first time I can remember being fascinated by AI and its capabilities, and my fondness has only continued to grow.

There are so many things that we can learn from AI, which leads me to my second reason. The tools that we have in our hands are so powerful, and I think that it can really help a lot of people. These projects are an amazing way to make something that is actually useful and can solve a real problem. I want to develop these skills of working with AI so I can make good tools and solve more problems.","Although I am open to all kinds of projects, I think that one of the things that interests me the most is image/video recognition. I have seen software that is able to look at objects or people and describe them, and I think those have a lot interesting capabilities. 

One idea I have heard is that the visually impaired can point their phone camera at things and get a description of the world around them. I have also thought many times that if I could just get cameras in the parking lots around campus and some image detection I would be able to accurately depict the number of open spots on an app that would save me and other students lots of time looking for parking.","Numpy, Pandas, Matlab",,"I have done a quarterly project before for IEEE. The project concept was an iOS app that would give the user an electric shock if they opened TikTok, or played games, or were generally off task. My portion of the project was the software design, where I created an app that would connect the phone's Bluetooth to the custom case that the team built. Using Bluetooth, the app was able to send signals to the case, telling it to zap the user. I wrote and deployed the app in C#, and we were able to build a successful prototype.","My biggest strength is my enthusiasm for programming.

I think that a website that automatically sorts your songs into playlists would be really useful for people who use Spotify like I do (which I think is a significant amount). I have tried to Google this problem and found some tools but there are a lot of problems with the ones that I have found and I think that our team could do better.

I'd love to have the opportunity to learn more about various machine learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. I aspire to learn how to implement these algorithms effectively to tackle real-world problems, such as classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation systems. Additionally, I am eager to explore advanced topics in machine learning, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, to expand my knowledge about this rapidly evolving field. This is a great opportunity for me to learn more about ML as it will give me the chance to apply what I'm going to learn in my introduction to Machine Learning course that I'm taking with UCSD's extended studies program. 

I also think it's important to hone my problem-solving abilities, as they are essential for overcoming challenges and achieving success in AI projects. Through a project with ACM, I aspire to enhance my capacity to analyze complex problems, break them down into manageable components, and devise innovative solutions. I am looking forward to learning different problem-solving strategies and methodologies to become a more effective problem solver in the context of AI and future CS projects.

Overall, I am excited about the opportunity to learn and grow within ACM Projects, and I am committed to investing the time and effort necessary to develop my skills in machine learning and problem-solving. This is a great opportunity for me to learn more about machine learning through a collaborative and hands-on approach, something that I'm currently unable to find elsewhere.","As the Assistant Coordinator of Community Affairs with UCSD Associated Students, I've encountered numerous scheduling clashes. This position required me to work with the schedules of many different stakeholders, like student organizations, my team members, and local non-profits. 

Our team's effectiveness stemmed from several key strategies. First and foremost, open communication. We established regular channels through Slack channels, emails, and shared calendars to keep everyone informed about meetings, events, and project deadlines. This transparent approach enabled us to proactively address scheduling conflicts by accommodating varied availabilities and finding common meeting times that suited the majority.

We also did our best to be as flexible as possible with our meetings, especially since we all had diverse schedules.  Rather than adhering strictly to fixed meeting times, we remained adaptable, utilizing scheduling tools to identify optimal meeting slots each week. Sometimes, if we were unable to meet in-person, we’d just meet on Zoom instead. This flexibility empowered team members to participate actively despite individual constraints.

Overall, my experience with AS has equipped me with invaluable insights into managing scheduling challenges within a team setting. By prioritizing open communication, flexibility, and strategic task distribution, we managed to collaborate more efficiently.","As someone who was still relatively new to both machine learning and coding, I set a goal to learn Python on my own. Without any formal guidance or UCSD CS classes, I navigated the complexities of Python independently.

Starting from scratch, I scoured the internet for beginner-friendly Python tutorials and resources. I immersed myself in online courses, YouTube videos, and interactive coding platforms, absorbing Python's syntax and concepts one line of code at a time. I found that what really helped was taking the initiative to create my own projects instead of just copying and pasting someone else’s work. Anytime I ran into any errors, I’d troubleshoot by testing out different potential solutions in different parts of my code. This process of trial and error was incredibly important as it helped me set a stronger foundation for Python, and it taught me how to think more critically about the work I was doing. Most importantly, I found that having a genuine curiosity and interest in coding and the projects I was working on really helped me to push through despite running into roadblocks.

Throughout my time working on this goal, I effectively learned how to code in Python and also discovered the importance of self-directed learning. With each challenge overcome and each line of code conquered, I grew more confident in my abilities. While I still have a long way to go in the vast world of machine learning and coding, my journey through Python has laid a solid foundation for future exploration and growth.","I'm still a beginner to machine learning, but I'm currently enrolled in a Machine Learning course with UCSD Extended Studies.",,AI,Hack,Design,10,5,"I am excited to participate in ACM AI Projects because of my deep interest in expanding my knowledge about AI. As someone who's still new to the field, this is an invaluable opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience and hone my skills in a supportive environment. 

Machine learning fascinates me due to its potential to revolutionize various industries and solve complex problems. Despite being a beginner, I am enthusiastic about delving deeper into this field and uncovering its potential applications for real-world issues. ACM AI Projects presents an ideal platform for me to take my first steps in machine learning, providing structured guidance and practical exposure that will help accelerate my learning journey.

Moreover, I am drawn to the collaborative nature of projects within ACM. I'd love to be working alongside like-minded students, each bringing their unique perspectives and expertise to the table. I believe that collaboration fosters creativity, innovation, and mutual growth, and I am eager to contribute to and learn from a dynamic team environment.

Furthermore, the hands-on nature of ACM AI Projects aligns perfectly with my learning style. I thrive in environments where I can apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, and this project offers precisely that opportunity. By actively participating in project development, I can gain a deeper understanding of machine learning concepts while simultaneously refining my problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

In summary, my desire to participate in ACM AI Projects stems from a combination of my passion for learning about machine learning, my appreciation for collaborative endeavors, and my preference for hands-on learning experiences.

I also think that participating in projects will also bring out more creativity as we are innovating and creating new projects. Working on these projects I think that I will gain valuable knowledge from peers, mentors, and the project itself and will not only provide me with the skills needed for the professional world, but skills that will improve myself overall. ","While working on our DS3 projects, finding a time where the whole team was able to meet and work together was difficult. We were all taking courses with heavy workloads and midterms were creeping up on us so everyone's schedules were pretty packed and it seemed like it was impossible to achieve any sort of progress on our project. So I decided to take action and here's how I did it: First, we made sure that we were actually meeting at least once a week even if it was a quick conference through me or other members giving constant reminders and asking what is everyone's availability for the concurrent week. I know that life can sometimes get extremely busy and people can forget about the project so these reminders were a good way to keep people engaged! Second, I made sure to give regular updates on my progress on the project. This again was another way to keep the rest of the team engaged on the project and was a sure way to keep everyone motivated to continue the project (no one wants to work on a standstill project)! Lastly, understanding that school takes priority is crucial. If me or any of the other people had exams, homework, or anything else important coming up, we would put the project to the side and focus on those instead. This was a sure-fire way to make sure that the project does not become a burden to do and was something that we actually looked forward to completing!","While preparing for data science internship interviews, I realized that SQL was a big part of the technical evaluations. However, I have yet to even touch SQL as I have not taken any courses or worked on any projects that utilize SQL. To address this problem, I had to do a lot of self-learning and here is how I did it: Leetcode or more specifically, the SQL50 problem sets on Leetcode. This was an awesome tool to practice SQL problems and actually try practical questions and learn through trying and failing. However, some of the problems were quite difficult to understand the solutions on my own so that's when I went to YouTube and TikTok to find a more in depth explanation. YouTube and TikTok helped me immensely by walking through the problems and giving tips/tricks on how to approach similar problems and what else to look for (check out Zach Wilson and @nicksinghtech they're really helpful with preparing for Data Science interviews!). If none of that worked, ChatGPT is also an extremely great tool for learning. It gives in-depth explanations for different problems and can also give you great tips! I think that everyone should be using ChatGPT to learn rather than having it to code, it's a much better teacher rather than a programmer.","I am honestly open to work on any skill level project!

In this position, I had to manage scheduling problems when we needed to decide when to hold officer meetings to plan out the competition. To do this, we had a group chat with all the officers where we shared what days we would be available after school. Using information from the chat, I figured out which days the most number of officers would be available and scheduled officer meetings based on it. This allowed us to decide on the meeting dates early to ensure no one would make overlapping plans with the meeting. However, something I could have done was have a separate Zoom meeting room for officers who weren't able to make it in person.","Working on my first ACM workshop as an events team staff, I had to spend a lot of time learning the JUCE framework for audio programming in C++.

So on the rare occasion that I am not present, I still demonstrate an active contribution, immediately responding to the job and putting in extra time to make up for the absence.","One program that I learned to use by myself was Adobe Photoshop. When I first installed the software, I instantly felt overwhelmed by all the features and its endless creative possibilities. In order to overcome this initial stress, I started out with a blank document. I toggled between the task bars, added images and shapes, and clicked on different tools to see what each feature did. I did this throughout the week until I could decently recall where the basic tools were and how they functioned. At the time, I also had a project for VIS41 and I really wanted to create something advanced on Photoshop. Therefore, I would go on Youtube and search tutorials for specific ideas I wanted to add to my project, such as, “how to create jelly texture in photoshop,” or “realistic sand writing in photoshop.” After following every tutorial precisely, I realized how quickly I saw my project idea come to life. More importantly, I saw that I naturally became more proficient in the software due to all the practice! It’s only been around 5 months since I began but I am really happy to now be able to create with Photoshop.","Recently, I’ve worked with my Design Co team to build a website extension for skincare user matching. I developed wireframes and prototypes through Figma and tested out different product ideas from my UX flows/research.

However, while I was working I was also on the cross country team and taking tutoring classes. Hence, I was always busy and often had scheduling conflicts with my work due to my tutoring classes and racing competitions; But it was crucial for me to be there to help my co-workers keep the children under control. So to overcome these scheduling conflicts, I create an availability sheet for the following month to provide my employers with the best idea of availability.

As of now, I am relatively unexperienced with frontend technology and how they interact with the backend. I'd like to know how to use these technologies and integrate them into a complete final project, especially while working in a collaborative environment.

I am unfamiliar with the general processes of how to get a programming idea into reality. Any experience with modern technology would be greatly valuable to me.","I can provide an example of when I assisted with getting together a surprise party for a friend. A few people couldn't visit in person so me and a couple of friends created a group chat with several others and had people vote on times they were available to enter a zoom call. We ended up all finding a time to get on a call to sing happy birthday and chill for a bit. Some people were quite unsure if they would be able to call on the specified time, so this uncertainty could have been mitigated if I had developed contingency plans for some people to still send a card or prerecorded video; but overall, most people arrived and I think we made a good situation out of poor one.","I've been able to learn 2 video editing software without any mentors. DaVinci Resolve is an advanced video editing platform with many different features. Similarly, I was able to learn and use CapCut Desktop for a school project that required me to use a cloud service to access the project from multiple computers. I took a project-oriented approach to learning these softwares not by binging videos or articles, but by doing as much as I could (even if that was just importing footage) and searching up specific editing techniques for the software I was using as the issues came up. This helped me avoid getting stuck in an overlearning loop, and actually experience problems in order to learn.

If we are talking about programming specifically, though, I have also had some issues. As a commuter I have a lot of friction going to campus a lot for tutor hours if I need help, which encouraged me to do a lot of self-learning. On several PAs in CSE 12, I couldn't figure out why my methods weren't working, and was able to learn basic use of the built in VSCode Debugger tool to identify object values at certain points during a test.","While I don't have much sponsored experience with programming, I have earned awards regarding my mathematical and logical ability. I feel like I can really flourish with the assistance of some more experienced mentors and/or peers who direct me in ways that allow me to leverage and further develop my creative problem-solving abilities. I'd like the chance to gain experience in full-stack development like in Hack, especially to develop my comprehensive ability by learning how front-end technologies work. Though if fluency in  MERN technologies is absolutely required, I feel I could still benefit with my python experience in the AI topic.",,Hack,AI,Design,7,3,"I have a lot of interest in the realms of AI and Machine Learning. I believe that more advanced technology can always be leveraged for more good, it just has to be used for the right purpose. These rapidly-advancing realms of technology can be applied to nearly every industry, allowing us to automate repetitive tasks with great precision, focus more on further innovation, and ideate and iterate hundreds to thousands of times faster. As a topic that relies heavily on statistics and data, I think my prior experience lends itself very well to the area, and I think ACM AI Projects is the greatest way I can kickstart my understanding of the underlying processes that go into an AI/ML/DL-related project.","I have a particular interest in natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision.

As the world grows faster and faster and people get more busy, I think it's important to have people who care more about creating and showing people the things that may be of real use to them without making them spend excess time searching for it on their own. In this way, I think ACM Design is a great way to learn how to get involved with a team and develop a comprehensive understanding of the design process using an efficient and effective project.",,,"HTML, CSS, Git/Github","Something I am looking for in a team would be good communicators who have an expressed intent to share ideas, experience, and create an overall mutually supportive environment. In a project like this, I'm not necessarily looking to create the most market-relevant, business model-proven project, but instead looking to interact with a team of people to create a prototype that finds a way to incorporate each member's experience and ideas. The benefit of approaching a project without the pressure of needing to make immediate profit is that everyone is able to prioritize learning from each other rather than outcomes. With that said, I think the best way to gain practical knowledge from each other is to find an area of shared interest to focus on.

Specifically, my tennis practice was right before my lacrosse practice, so instead of cleaning up and putting everything away after tennis with the rest of the team, I worked a deal with my coach where I would show up early to my practice and help him set up. That way I could leave right away and go change for lacrosse and be there on time for my second practice or game.

For example, those who mainly worked on the UI were pair programming since they had similar free times, same for backend and integrations folks. We also regularly posted updates in the group chat whenever a cool feature was done which reaches everyone despite their schedule.","I recently learned React Query. It helped that I had done data fetching without it so I knew that you should have a loading state, error, and data passed back from some useData() function, but learning the API it provides was incredibly easy thanks to its well-written documentation.

","During a class project, I worked on a team of four, where we had to work with electrical components in person as well as online documentation. When we needed to work on tasks outside of class and couldn’t find a common time that everyone could make, we would choose the time that works for the most people. Then those who couldn’t make it would take on remote tasks, such as updating on our online poster. Then we would communicate in the group chat about our progress from that session, so everyone stayed up to date. This was effective because people who had scheduling problems could still contribute and stay up to date on the situation, but this is only a short term solution for the occasional schedule conflict. A more long term solution could be dividing the total work between smaller groups whose schedules work better, and then regularly updating the other group with everyone’s progress.

When I was stuck, I found it helpful to look up the name of the tool and the software online, and then read through various websites. Oftentimes, I couldn’t find the answer right away, so I would change up the key words I used or watch various YouTube tutorials. Using these tactics, eventually I was able to figure out how to use the design tools.

","In one of my projects, my team used When2Meet for scheduling meetings. We tried to set a consistent meeting time (weekly meetings at the same time) but it somehow did not really work for us since people's plans can change all the time. As a result, we ended up meeting at random times of the week just by texting what times people are available, and whoever could not make it to the meeting would just get an update with meeting notes. However, I think we as a team did an effective job of fixing this problem by filling out multiple When2meets each week, which helps each one of us to be set for a meeting that week. Although meeting times could not be consistent for a specific day, we still met up once a week but just during on different days. This made us less stressed about canceling meetings and having someone to not be able to show up. We also did an effective job of having detailed meeting notes in case someone could not make it at all.

","For my first ever website prototype (a skincare website), I learned how to use Visily (a UI design software). Since the project focus was to just create a content using a combination of AI tools, Visily seemed more suitable and more simpler than Figma at the time. I saw that Visily could generate a template using AI if you provided a website picture for reference. So, I used that tool to get the base of my website style. I tweaked around with the designs, eventually forming it to mostly my own design when I got the hang of it. I also experimented a lot by adding much more content such as AI generated skin care products, ingredients, customer reviews, and more. It was fun to see what I could design as I get more exposed to the tools that Visily had. Mostly it was the experimentation for me to figure out how to use Visily, as this was my first ever prototype that I designed on my own. I think this experimentation helped me transform into getting used to Figma, which was a helpful foundation. ","I took part in a quarter-long project in the class COGS 123 where our team had to create a novel social computing system. We created a choreographer and dancer interaction experience extension to TikTok called ""TikTok Groove"" where many skills was required for me to do such as researching, interviewing, surveys, designing screens (lo-fi and hi-fi), and prototyping demonstration in front of the class. I have also had some specific experiences in the research aspect of creating SWOT analysis' and storyboards, organizing survey and interview answers into an affinity diagram, and contribute to coming up with a problem statement. I've also done some creations of UX flows and UI designs where I helped create a skincare website prototype with a team.

I currently only have one non-related school project, but I feel that the community was not as tight-knit and committed. I also do not feel like I learned and get enough experience from that. However looking at the ACM past projects and the photos of teams working together in discord, it looks like a really fun and dedicated group of designers who want to get the best out of the project, and not only successfully complete the project, but also make long-lasting designer friends. I feel that gaining a closer connection with people who need more experience would be a perfect combination for me to progress as a designer. I would also love to not only display my creative ideas and design skills to produce an excellent product, but also love to receive beneficial feedback and different point of views to better improve myself.","I recently finished a class project (COGS 123) where my team and I designed a whole dance centric TikTok extension dedicated for choreographers and dancers. This was my first big UX/UI project ever and I accomplished many tasks such as designing and organizing the multiple slide decks we had to create, designing some low fidelity and high fidelity screens in Figma, conducting interviews, analyzing competitive + technology research, and creating a portfolio for it. I also helped coming up with ideas on how to prototype the user experience in front of the whole class which was a success (according to the feedback we received). I have also created an animation software prototype where my team and I focused on features that can help novice animators know how to animate well. I am also currently in the process of finishing up a project where my team and I are designing a skincare browsing website that is convenient for users to shop for products that suit their skin. Back in high school, I have also designed multiple infographics and posters. My favorite design-related work I have accomplished in high school is the yearbook, where I designed 60+ pages on my own.", I'd really appreciate to participate in these projects :) I'm still a bit new to UX/UI design as a third year so it'd be great to have a solid project outside of class! ,,,No,,,Yes,No,Female,Asian,Spring 2024

","In my junior year of high school I was part of a club called DECA where we researched and wrote a 20 paged report on an existing business. Near the competition date, we still had a lot to do but little time left to complete the project. My two teammates and I were all super stressed because we could not find any dates available to meet in person during the next two weeks and we still had a lot we needed to fix. At the end, we settled on spending one day calling and designating tasks, and then working remotely on the project whenever we had time after that. I think I did an effective job at handling the issue because I was the one who came up with this solution and the one who offered to free up some of my own time to call the other two members individually whenever they were free and catch our whole team up separately. I moved around my plans/classes in order to accommodate their schedules. It was a hard for all three of us to meet so I was the mediator and relied the problem or caught the other member up via phone call on what was new in the project whenever me and another teammate worked on it. This solution worked for us and we ended up getting 1st place at a statewide competition. If I could I would've started working on the project a lot sooner and completed it way past the deadline in order to avoid all of this stress. I underestimated how much time it would take us to perfect and be happy with the report. ","During my summer year before college, I figured out that I wanted to pursue UI/UX design so I spent my entire summer teaching myself how to use Figma. I set a checklist for myself and every week I went to the library in order to fully commit myself to learning the application. Working with Figma is something that you perfect after using it multiple times and even after years of use there is always something new you can learn so I started early. I watched countless videos online and even tried a few design challenges and made some flyers for friends on Figma. In addition, I enrolled in UCSD's Coursera Design Course that was offered online my winter quarter in order to further familiarize myself with Figma and I would say that I still have a lot to learn but I am pretty comfortable with utilizing the app now!","As an artistically inclined individual, I spend most of my free time drawing or working on a new personal passion project. I've worked with digital art, traditional art, block-printing, screen-printing, paper art, ceramics, jewelry making, sculpting, wood-working, and many other types of artwork. To elaborate on an example of a human-centered design project that I’ve previously participated in, for DECA my partner and I created a 20 paged report, detailing a written strategic plan based on the results of a research study for our local bookstore Half Price Books and I designed, budgeted, as well as generated some visuals in our report. We completely redesigned HPB's entire website, even introducing new elements such as the ""Book Type Quiz"" in order to improve the website and we also proposed to give users with an annual end-of-year summative report of their reading behavior through: “Pages of My Life.” I designed how the ""Pages of My Life"" would primarily look, and based it off of HPB's customer demographics. Lastly, we generated a new mockup of the filters on HPB's website and wire-framed some examples of the mobile app. I’ve attached this report in a link above. Last but not least, at UCSD I'm part of KDST's creative team and a TSE TEST designer, which can account for my professional experience.

However, there were times when our schedules would clash, so we had to rework each of our schedules around to fit in time. I believe that we did an effective job with this because we always made time to meet every week, and if there were too many conflicts during the weekdays, we were open to meeting on the weekends in order to finish our project assignment for the week.

learning curve to it. During sophomore year of high school, I joined the yearbook community, exposing me to this particular software. As a staff member my first year, I soon realized that I would need to be able to make the very spreads that the editors painstakingly designed over the span of less than two weeks most of the time. Looking up to them and seeing that position for me the next year, I decided to start learning on my own. Having already known the very basic tools, the next step was for me to work on full-page spreads. I looked up inspiration on Pinterest and did my best to copy the ones I liked, while putting my own twist on it. At first, my basic knowledge of the tools felt as if it did not help me, but soon, I began to use the shortcuts with ease and felt more confident with every click. Working as an editor the next year, having this prior self-taught experience made designing spreads more streamlined. Even so, there were setbacks along the way: other editors did not like my initial designs, and there were times when I did not feel the urge to work on a design.

During the program, we were assigned a task to use our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills together to build a website. At first, we all discussed different ideas everyone had so that the website could be a reflection of everyone's work and thinking. I realized that each of my team members had different opinions so I suggested that we should together work towards finding a common interest and select a topic with which we all resonated. Since we were all in different countries, we had to meet and work virtually through Zoom. We effectively decided on a time that worked for everyone based on their availability for our bi-weekly meetings. Apart from that, I wanted to give my best and hence I had to devote extra time to achieve our desired goal. I also realized not all of my team members had the same amount of prior experience so we all helped each other whenever someone had a problem. I also created various deadlines for myself so that I was able to complete my assigned task on time and my team wouldn't stay behind. Along with that, I suggested that we hold a check-in meeting every week in which we discussed all of our progress and if we wanted to change something. At last, we were able to build an interesting and interactive website together despite all of our challenges. I realized that while working as a team I had to make certain adjustments too so that we could together achieve our goal and I ended up making lifelong friends too!","When I shifted schools in 11th grade, I had a vast exposure to the different fields that are associated with Computer Science. I wanted to apply to one of the most competitive clubs in my school. During the selection process, I was assigned various AI and ML tasks that required proficiency in Python language. I had no experience in that area so I first picked up a course from the University of Michigan to learn Python coding. Then, to learn more about data classification and sorting, I learned about Matplotlib and Pandas modules through their official websites online. With an ongoing zeal, I was assigned a task to build a CNN so I had to familiarise myself with the different modules required like Tensorflow and Keras by reading various online articles. There were times when my code didn't work or I couldn't understand the error message but I decided not to give up. During this time, I sought help from platforms like StackOverflow and Kaggle.

While, majority of the team lived in the US, however, one member was working remotely from India. I tried to schedule the meeting during 7pm PST to try and accommodate the person in India. However, this arrangement would have lead my manager having to take the meeting at 10 pm because she lived on the east coast. She later told me that while she recognized I was trying to accommodate the team member in India, it would be unreasonable for her to take the meeting at 10 pm. Due to the nature of work team compositions, team members in India were accustomed to working at later times in the night due to majority of co-workers working from the US and Europe. As such, I rescheduled the meeting to ensure my manager was able to attend. Personally, I could've done a better job by being more aware of existing culture surrounding work.

Because of this, we had to meet outside of class to work on our project. Even though we had an assigned project manager, she was a bit shy. So instead I took up the mantle, organizing times to meet up amidst people's busy schedules. I think I did a really good job adapting to my new role, and we ended up getting the project done on time.

There were some issues when I or my teammates unexpectedly couldn't be on campus to work with my teammates but we were able to be flexible and would meet on zoom sometimes or even have hybrid meetings where some of my teammates were in person while others were online. I could've done a better job at avoiding this problem in the first place and made sure that my schedule did not overlap with other commitments. Later on my other groups used a scheduling tool that provided for an effective way of finding a time where everyone was available. The tool automatically finds times that work with everyone based on what times they set as available. I found it to be really helpful because it visually showed a calendar week with time slots that everyone was available for. The website is when2meet.com and I thought this to be really effective for other group projects in this course :) ,"A tool that I've wanted to get a better hang of recently is Figma.

A very important decision we made was to communicate with each member directly to get an understanding of what their schedule was, as well as adding extra-emphasis on the important of attending meetings. We kept track of everyone's schedule using Google Sheets, with information on the times and days each member was available. Although it was still rare everybody came to the meetings, there were more people at each meeting because of the organization me and the founding members did.","Over this spring break, I've been working on creating pre-training a BERT model that can read and ""understand"" decompiled pseudo-code, which has many applications in cybersecurity. When I first started off, I had no idea what I was doing, but after reading through some tutorials on how to train a BERT model, as well getting a good understanding of BERT and transformers through reading research papers, I was able to make some progress. The library that I used mainly for this project was called HuggingFace, which has a plethora of helpful documentation for their models, datasets, and trainers. Through the reading of this documentation as well as help from Chat-GPT and Co-Pilot in solving the variety of bugs, I was able to get a first elementary model trained.

We began working on our project involving brainstorming ideas, research, data analysis, and forming conclusions. The team consisted of members with different schedules, and many of us had other priorities to attend, such as family, sports, and other extracurricular activities. Identifying our priorities and commitments individually and together made us understand our different schedules to be able to work around our other tasks and build a strong commitment to scheduling meetings and having collaborative time for our project work. I brought attention to how we should adopt a flexible schedule to meet based on everyone's availability and have a clear communication system such as having channels online to text and call each other. We made sure to consistently update each other on areas of the project as well. Another way we had an effective job was to install a proper task distribution, where we could complete asynchronously on small tasks of the project before coming together for collaborative work. One thing I could've improved on was setting more clear and realistic expectations when it came to deadlines. Even though my team and I were able to navigate around any conflicts regarding the scheduling and deadlines, we realized that certain tasks of our project took longer than expected to finish. By understanding this, my team and I will continue to make sure to set small concrete deadlines to give us time to double-check and have extra time to complete any tasks before a major deadline. ","One example is when I began learning how to code using Python. Throughout high school, I worked closely with Javascript, HTML, and CSS, but as I graduated I learned how many projects and work within the CS field involved Python. After graduation, I began teaching myself Python so that I would hopefully be proficient once I came to college. I started by utilizing online tutorials and programs, such as freeCodeCamp, KhanAcademy, and Codeacadmy. I was able to understand the foundation of Python and its basics as a beginner. Through the videos and examples that these programs offered me, I began to apply what I had learned to simple hands-on projects. When I bumped into an error, I would specifically identify what it was and use YouTube and Google to help me find a solution to what I was doing wrong. I would also experiment with my code to learn my mistakes as well. Over time, I continued applying my knowledge of using Python to more coding projects and I applied the trial and error mindset to my work. Since my personal projects weren't on a deadline, I spent a lot of time learning how to properly code using Python and took time to understand it step by step. With practice, I was able to gain a stronger proficiency, and once I came into college I took CS courses, allowing me to further build my skills with the coding language for my future.

I have not taken any AI related courses at all; I have only started to take the intro to AI course this quarter, so I will be learning along as I go for this project. However, I believe that learning the more theoretical side of AI, while pursuing the practical aspect of the project on the side will help me learn best. It allows me to put into practice and see the concepts that I will learn in the coming weeks, come to fruition. For such a complicated and diverse topic like AI, there is so much to learn that it can be overwhelming to want to learn all of it at once. That's why I believe ACM Projects AI would be a great opportunity for me to try working on a project for an aspect of AI, solidify and dip my toes into this field, which will help propel me forward into doing even more discovery of the topic. Beyond the technical aspect, I believe it will also be beneficial for me to continue experience working in a group on a project. I have worked on various group projects before, and they each teach me new things about working in a group. It is a valuable skill to hone and possess because things become easier and better once you discuss them in a group setting. Through ACM Projects, I hope to gain the opportunity to really explore and be hands on with AI, all while exploring this vast and interesting topic with a group of like minded individuals and peers. ","I was recently in a group project for my software engineering class last quarter. Initially, we had scheduled times for regular meetings, but due to other classes and commitments, a lot of times we did not meet at those times. I took the initiative in the more crucial weeks, especially weeks nearing deadlines, to propose to my group mates about meeting in the CSE basement, finding a time that would be convenient for all of us. At this point in time, we stopped having labs for the class, but I knew we would all have that time free, so I proposed that we meet for 3 hours and work on the project together, in person. These meetings were when we accomplished the most and were able to bond over out of class issues. I think I did a pretty effective job at helping to facilitate group meetings and making sure that everyone knew their expectations for the week so that we would be able to successfully completely the project in time. In retrospect, I think one thing that I could have done better was help make sure we were more proactive in attending meetings earlier on, so that we did not feel rushed. I was also guilty of not feeling like the initial meetings were important, but I understand now that if we establish good meeting habits earlier on, then our group as a whole could have been even more successful and manage our time better.","For my research that I am currently doing, I had to learn how to code in Python by myself for the first time. It was more for data analysis, but I struggled a lot in the beginning because of a lack of experience and familiarity with the programming language. However, I did have experience in other languages like Java and C++, so I knew that I could deal with the fundamentals of the language. What I tried next was to simply just start coding in Python. I started with looking up how to write a function/method in Python and simply copied, typing it up exactly. Because I already had prior knowledge in basic coding concepts, I was able to look up documentation and coding examples for loops and conditionals, and was able to pick it up quickly. As for the various Python packages, I slowly did research on the packages that were necessary; I did not try to learn everything all at once. Because this was a data analysis and data visualization project, I focused more on learning how to use difflib, tokenizer, and matplotlib. I would look at the documentation first for these packages and code up some test code, playing around with it. This let me become familiar with how the package worked. Once I felt comfortable enough, I applied that knowledge into the work that I needed to, testing and confirming my work along the way. It wasn't easy learning a new language on my own without a class and guidance, but I believe that the best way to learn is by doing. By playing around with Python and just slowly doing various tests, I was able to teach myself how to code with Python for basic purposes. I believe this is a skill that will be necessary for Projects, and I believe it will transfer over. ","As for technical abilities for AI projects, I do not possess any experience, but I am very eager and excited to learn. I have previously attended a couple AI workshops before, but nothing very long term. I have only begun to take an intro to AI course this quarter, so as of now, I do not have much experience. However, I do have knowledge in coding in Python, for the basic programming concepts, so I would be able to deal with the coding in Python for AI more easily.

The potential that AI has in the future within the next 5-10 years alone is something that interests me very much. Thus, I would love to be able to propel my knowledge as fast as I can by immersing myself in a project with ACM AI. I believe this would be the best way to learn about working with AI.

I gained insights into software engineering, teamwork, and the intricacies of software development. I learned that pursuing projects is the best way to truly grasp practical concepts and tackle real-world problems.

This time around, I'm eager to explore the field of AI by getting involved in an ACM AI project, aiming to deepen my understanding of AI. In high school, I undertook a few AI projects but felt like I didn't fully understand many of the concepts. I've often heard about Deep Learning and Computer Vision but haven't fully grasped these concepts yet. Engaging in projects that utilize Machine Learning and Deep Learning would be really interesting! Through ACM Projects, I'm looking forward to working on an AI project with a team, collaborating with my teammates, and learning about AI through project development. 

I usually code in Java, so through this project, I would also love to develop my Python coding skills and delve deeper into Python programming! I would be very interested in learning about different frameworks and libraries in Python as well such as Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.","When we were working on our ACM Hack project during the winter quarter, there were times when completing certain tasks became challenging due to availability issues. For instance, there were instances when no one from the backend development team could meet up with the front-end development team, and we needed to integrate front end and back end. Particularly during finals week and the week preceding it, scheduling meetings proved to be a challenge.

Despite these scheduling conflicts, we made a concerted effort to plan meetings that accommodated everyone's convenience. We held weekly meetings in the library, which was a convenient location for everyone since most of us studied there anyway. On days when in-person attendance was not possible for some team members, we would switch to Discord voice chat or Zoom. This ensured that our communication remained uninterrupted and that we could discuss the week's progress effectively.

Initially, we used Lettucemeet to organize our meetings, which was instrumental in navigating our conflicting schedules. If someone still couldn't attend a meeting, we made sure to fill them in later. This flexibility and commitment to communication helped us become more efficient. ","I was working on the backend in the ACM Hack project, and backend development involves learning various technologies, experimenting to see what works, and often figuring things out on your own. One task I was assigned was implementing authentication for our web app, which required me to learn about the Google API. It took me some time to get a handle on it. I had to read a lot of documentation and watch many YouTube videos. Even then, there were moments when it didn't work.

I found myself confused about how to test if my code was functioning correctly. To do this, I needed to learn some front-end skills, such as HTML and CSS, to create a dummy website. Once I created the dummy website, I proceeded to code the backend part, referring to the Passport.js documentation and the Google API documentation. I also had to learn a lot about MongoDb.

This endorsement would not only enhance the platform's credibility but also attract a diverse user base from different regions and cultures.

Moreover, our social media website could incorporate innovative features that promote user engagement while respecting privacy. For example, we could implement customizable privacy settings that allow users to control who can view their content and interact with them. Additionally, we could explore features such as ephemeral messaging, where content automatically disappears after a certain period, enhancing privacy and encouraging authentic interactions.

In summary, the project idea revolves around creating a privacy-focused social media platform that combines the engaging elements of popular platforms like Instagram with a commitment to user privacy and data protection. By offering an ad-less experience, promoting global recognition, and incorporating innovative privacy features, I want to redefine social media in a way that prioritizes user control and meaningful interactions.",Yes,No,Male,Asian,Spring 2024

I've done a bit of programming stuff on my own, but since a lot of development happens in groups, I'd really like to get the experience of developing a project in a group. The iterative cycle of working on projects also really interests me for potentially a project management role down the line, and I feel like ACM projects would be a great way to observe and participate in these processes. I'd also like to learn some SWE-specific tools that are used in the industry and/or some applications of AI/ML. In addition to new skills, I also want to brush up and reinforce my knowledge of some languages that I've had prior experience with, such as JavaScript and Python; I also took CSE 12 last quarter and am hoping to see some actual applications of data structures in programming projects (and not just in Leetcode questions). Outside of technical skills, I'd also like to work on soft skills such as communication and discipline, and I feel like the accountability of a group project setting is a great way to work on these skills. ","Last quarter I took DSGN 1, which was pretty much entirely based on group projects. For our last two projects, we had groups of 4 and 6 respectively, and so the larger group sizes meant it was harder to schedule times to meet up and work on projects. I thought these meetings were crucial for project progress, so I took the initiative when it came to scheduling and made sure to get everyone's schedules so that we could choose the optimal time where everyone was available. If someone wasn't available in person, then I suggested alternate ways like a phone call or Zoom meeting so that we could still have the entire group working on the project at once. If we couldn't figure out a time when everyone was available, we would choose the next best time and just assign parts of the projects to the people who couldn't show up so we could still stay on track. 

In this aspect, I think the way I handled things was pretty effective. In the past (both for other classes and previous DSGN 1 projects), I had failed to take initiative to schedule things, which either led to failures in communication or personal dissatisfaction with the way things were handled - so I tried to build on these past failures. I've found that, although everyone is usually thinking about it, sometimes it takes someone else voicing their thoughts first to encourage them to chime in, and this can be especially true for scheduling and/or schedule problems/conflicts.","While I was working on a Chrome extension that was started in an ACM Hack workshop, I ran into a lot of issues with understanding how the files within the extension actually interacted with each other and generally how to make sure things were working properly. This wasn't an issue during the workshop, since that wasn't the focus of it, but when attempting to continue developing it on my own, I got curious.

So, to try and make sense of what was going on, I referred heavily to Google's official Chrome extension documentation and tutorials, which I found to be helpful. The documentation was also really helpful for attempting to add features that weren't covered in the workshop, such as adding a favicon, or things like understanding the error messages and learning how to debug the extension. What was probably even more helpful was the time I spent just changing one thing at a time to see what happened and how each file/block of code was important for running the extension. I think messing around and tinkering with the code like that helped me reinforce what I was learning since I could directly see the effects of changing, adding, or removing something from the code.",N/A,Srujam Dave,Hack,AI,,5-7 hours,2,"As a Cogs-ML major, I'd love to get some practical Python and AI/ML experience before hitting the related upper-division classes, so there are a lot of potential academic benefits. I'm also just really interested in the applications of AI/ML and, as someone with little experience, I feel like the best and easiest way to get engaged with these sorts of technologies is by learning as a group. I attended the projects showcase last quarter and some of the AI projects were really cool, so I'd love to take a stab at one myself!","I'd love to work on a project that uses sentiment analysis or other NLP-related methods since these have been the AI projects that have interested me the most. There's a ton of stuff that you can use AI/ML for relating to written text, but a YouTube comment or Reddit post sentiment analyzer just seems more interesting and relevant. There's also a ton of variety in what you could analyze - you could try to look at emotions, sarcasm, political-ness, etc., and you could look at mass user-generated data (like social media) or existing bodies of written and proofread text.

Another area that really interests me is doing some sort of recognition/classification based on visual data - for example, feeding a model a bunch of faces, and then having it recognize faces in images or attempt to create a face based on observed common features. I've always been fascinated by YouTube videos attempting these sorts of projects, and while they don't always turn out as successful as one might expect, I feel like these projects are especially great for learning. Again, there's also a lot of variety in what you can choose to train the model with; you could do faces, objects, art, landscapes, animals, etc., so there are a lot of different ways the project could go!",,"In addition to checking out the AI projects at last quarter's showcase, I've been to a couple of the workshops last quarter, as well as one of the socials! I'm also looking forward to attending more of the workshops/other ACM AI events this quarter since I can make more time outside of classes for club activities.","I've been working on a Chrome extension that uses Google Gemini to summarize lecture transcripts into a format that I can easily export into Notion or Google Docs. It actually started at an ACM Hack workshop, but after the workshop, I wanted to take future development into my own hands so I could have more direct learning and understanding of what I was doing. While a lot of the starter code was provided, I did the prompt engineering and output formatting myself to get a sense of how to wrangle LLM output to get something usable for myself. Additionally, I've been looking into the documentation and starter templates for Chrome extensions to get a better understanding of how an extension actually works and what each file does, since a lot of that was already provided.",,,,,,,,,,,"HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Git/Github","I'm particularly interested in data visualization, so it would be nice to work on a project or with a team to integrate it in some way, whether it's the main focus of the project or just an aspect of the overall project that I can do a lot of the hands-on work for. I'd also like to learn more about front-end and back-end, so it would be nice to work in a group where those responsibilities are shared amongst everyone instead of just having a few people work on one aspect and a few on the other. Besides that, I don't have any other areas I'd like to emphasize; I'm down for pretty much anything, and I'm mainly just looking for the experience of development and working with a team/project management frameworks.",No,,"I have a few different ideas relating to Webreg and CAPE/SET data. Probably the most prominent one would be aggregating CAPE/SET data and displaying it next to classes in Webreg (or on a different website that gets class schedule information from Webreg) to make choosing/enrolling in classes easier. There could even be some sort of LLM integration that's specifically engineered to act as a (informal) academic advisor for further help picking classes (inspired by the likes of TritonGPT) - I could definitely see this being a useful project for learning while also having some real-world benefit, like helping first-years through their first quarter's enrollment.

Another related project would be just focusing on the data aggregation part and visualizing data in a clear and easily digestible way, much like Seascape (as a more detailed example) or SunSET, as I feel like it would be a great way to practice working with large amounts of data in a way that's relevant and interesting.

Outside of school-related things, I would also be really interested in reverse-engineering a simpler social media site like Talkomatic, where multiple users can be online at once and split off into different chat rooms. In general, I think reverse-engineering any social media website would make for an interesting and fulfilling project - or potentially even attempting to make our own site that draws inspiration from others.

There was a local round that would determine if we were able to compete internationally, and we were having struggles scheduling study sessions. One person preferred to meet directly after school, while another preferred to study at night because they had an after school class.
To fix this, we had a discussion and decided on a compromise. We agreed to alternate study session times. This worked since there would not be as much pressure every day for one member and it also let us be more accountable on the days we met after school since it would hold us more accountable. This approach allowed us to maintain a consistent study routine while accommodating everyone's schedules.
By being flexible and open to compromise, we were able to ensure that each team member was at their optimal mindset to contribute and participate in study sessions. 
Looking back, one area where that could have potentially been improved was better communication while planning ahead. It was not always an ABAB repetition as sometimes there were extenuating circumstances. Those circumstances sometimes could have been brought up beforehand but sometimes they were not and we had to quickly change. Establishing a more structured schedule in advance would have helped streamline the process.
Ultimately, despite the scheduling challenges, our teamwork and flexibility paid off. We successfully competed internationally in Prague and placed tenth place out of over 100 teams.

Why do you want to participate in ACM AI Projects?
I want to participate in ACM AI Projects because it is a fantastic opportunity for me to delve deeper into the field of artificial intelligence, particularly as I major in data science. This opportunity offers an environment where I can apply theoretical knowledge to real-world projects and gain practical experience in developing AI solutions.

One of my motivations for joining is to expand my skill set in classical machine learning. Along with majoring in data science, I am also planning to hopefully double major in cognitive science with an emphasis on machine learning. While I have a theoretical understanding of machine learning algorithms, participating in a real project would allow me to get hands-on experience in applying these techniques to solve practical problems. This hands-on experience is invaluable for building confidence and expertise for the future.

Overall, ACM AI Projects offer an excellent starting point for me to deepen my understanding of AI, particularly in classical machine learning, and to kickstart my journey towards a successful career in data science and machine learning.

To address these challenges, our team has set and prioritized using clear communication channels to make sure that everyone is aware of their tasks. We mainly use Facebook Messenger, Discord, and ClickUp to communciate asynchronously and monitor each others' progress.

Since it would be difficult to find a good time to meet every week, we would instead be flexible and try to hold meeting every two weeks instead. I would send out a lettucemeet link for everyone to fill out and identify common time slots for meetings to agree on. Some people would still not be able to attend the meeting but the turn out has been better. Then, my teammates would give updates to those who did not attend.

At first, we would add donation links to our website by manually hard-coding and sorting each link into the HTML document. We realized that this process was very inefficient. 

Since I was the youngest member in the team with the most free time and the least programming experience, my teammates all gave me a challenge -- they wanted me to learn Firebase so we could dynamically update the donation links in the website, and to learn JavaScript to create a sorting algorithm that would automatically alphabetize the links.

I started by reading the official documentations of Firebase and JavaScript. This gave me a good guide as to how I would connect Firebase to our React application via Authentication. It also provided me with some example code to help me get started much quicker. 

After quickly browsing these documentations, I used a lot of blogs and YouTube videos especially to learn the JavaScript sorting algorithms and how to integrate it within our webiste. I even tried searching for other GitHub repositories that might include similar patterns or techniques that might be applicable to our website.

Balancing my schedule was essential as I had classes both before and after most shifts, and during the fall quarter, I faced bi-weekly DSC quizzes immediately after one of my shifts. 
To navigate these scheduling challenges effectively, I prioritized preparation for my quizzes, ensuring I was fully ready as I couldn't afford last-minute reviews. Additionally, I allocated specific time slots for working on class assignments, maintaining consistency to manage them efficiently alongside my internship responsibilities. 
By meticulously managing my time and ensuring that neither my academic nor internship commitments were compromised, I successfully prevented any conflicts between the two responsibilities. ","While working on my Bluetooth speaker project, I encountered the need to use a soldering machine, despite having no prior experience with it. To tackle this challenge, I began by watching a tutorial on how to operate the machine, ensuring I followed all safety precautions. Although the tutorial didn't feature the exact same machine I had, I focused on identifying similarities to understand how my machine operated.
After grasping the basics, I proceeded to practice soldering. Fortunately, this step proved relatively straightforward – I figured that i had to melt the solder onto the materials I intended to connect and avoid bridging, facilitating the soldering process for my project.","I have a strong proficiency in Python, having utilized it extensively in my first two data science classes, where I did well in both projects and assignments. Additionally, while I may have some rustiness due to a four-year gap since my AP Computer Science class in high school, I possess intermediate-level skills in Java. However, I am committed to sharpening my Java skills as I'll be utilizing it heavily in my upcoming data science class this quarter.","Sanat, Adrian",AI,Hack,Design,10,4,"
I am eager to participate in ACM AI projects for several reasons. Firstly, I have a genuine interest and passion for coding and problem-solving, and engaging in projects provides me with the perfect platform to pursue both of these interests simultaneously.
Secondly, as a first-year student with relatively few activities on my resume, I view involvement in ACM AI projects as a valuable opportunity to enhance my productivity and bolster my resume.
Furthermore, I am deeply intrigued by the fields of AI and machine learning and would like to expand my knowledge in these areas, joining this project will help me with that mainly especially since i am currently not and have not previously taken any any AI or ML classes. In addition participating in these projects as a chance to apply the knowledge and skills I've acquired from my coursework in a practical setting.
Lastly, I've been wanting to work on a project but have been unsure of where to start or how to proceed. Joining an ACM AI project seems like an ideal starting point, providing me with valuable insights and guidance on how to approach personal projects in the future.","I would like to work on sport AI-related projects, economics/financial AI-related project, car and other tech related AI projects, Algorithms related AI projects and anything practical application based projects.","Numpy, Pandas",I have not been involved  with ACM AI activities,"I worked on an EnVision project.

I want to participate in ACM Design projects for several reasons. Firstly, design is really interesting to me and is something that i want to learn. I came close to taking a web design class in high school but due to scheduling conflict i could not take it but web design is something i want to learn.
Secondly, I think working on a team will be a good experience for me because everyone will have their responsibilities while working together toward a finished product or goal. This will help mw improve on my team work ability and communication.
thirdly, as a first-year student with not much to do outside classes and academic things, with relatively few activities on my resume, I view being in ACM AI projects will be a valuable opportunity to enhance my productivity in college while also bolstering my resume.

Furthermore, I would also like to deepen my understanding deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Decision tree, Random forest algorithm, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). Due to my strong interest in imaging processing, signaling, and data visualization, I would like to more comfortable with tools like Tableau and Microsoft Excel and the data wrangling process. Last but not least, interpersonal skills, such as efficient communication and collaboration, are the key to success for every project. I would like to thank and take the advantage of ACM projects to use Git and Google Colab to contribute to the team work and learn from my fellows. 

","When I was in Standford Persolv Bootcamp, we faced a challenge, which is being part of a global remote team consisting of 3 members from different countries. We are spread across different time zones, making synchronous meetings challenging. A crucial project milestone is approaching, which asked us to present our data and our code for classification to but recent progress has been hampered by scheduling conflicts, leading to delays and growing frustration within the team. In order to move quickly and work efficiently, I used when2meet to check for everyone's availability through the week and try to figure out the best time for that week. We also try to use asynchronous methods to provide checkpoints and progress of each other.","When I was asked to learn  LORIS, which is a a web-based data and project management software for neuroimaging research studies, I was only given a github link. Never get a chance to really learn how to use Git and Github or even Terminal, I have to learn them myself in order to access LORIS and contribute to the team work. I began by googling how to download Git on Mac, including learning about command, cd/ls, pathway, directory, and so forth. After several trial and errors, I downloaded Git and also the git hub; to get even more familiar with the system, I read through the  GitHub Guides and the GitHub Help documentation, which helps me explain the GitHub flow, how to create things like repositories, and how to manage files and collaborate with others on projects. I also learned that files/documents like README and configuration/set up to navigate the project. ","Some skills I have learned: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Furthermore, I also hope to gain more experience with the version control system like Github and learn to use communicative tools and methods to collaborate with my other fellow peers and grasp knowledge from the experienced mentors. I firmly believe that group work is critical in any types of projects as they foster a culturally inclusive environment for everyone to achieve mutual growth by consistently learning and getting valuable insights and by practicing professional skills. As a student doubled majoring in Cognitive Science w/specialization in ML and Data Science, ACM AI projects offer me with such a valuable chance to really harness my core skills in the field of computer science and data science and will prepare me with sufficient experiences to contribute to other open source projects in the future or conduct my own. ","As a student majoring in Cognitive Science w/ ML, I am interested in the intersection between health care and AI.

I believe I did an effective job by ensuring open communication among all team members throughout the scheduling process. By regularly updating the team on the status of responses and any changes to the proposed meeting times, I helped keep everyone informed and engaged in the decision-making process.

However, reflecting on the experience, I recognize areas where I could have improved. Firstly, I could have been more proactive in identifying potential scheduling conflicts earlier on, allowing for smoother coordination. Additionally, I could have implemented clearer guidelines or deadlines for team members to submit their availability, ensuring a more timely response and reducing the need for prolonged back-and-forth discussions. Overall, while I believe I facilitated effective communication, there are certainly areas for improvement in streamlining the scheduling process for future projects.","In a previous project, I taught myself PyTorch to build an NBA stat predicting model.

I want to learn more practical applications for what I've learned in my CS classes and what I've taught myself already. For example, while I've taught myself some HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, I'd want to learn more about backend development through an ACM HACK project, as well as how to structure and organize my projects using the Agile process. Alternatively, if I was accepted into an AI project, I'd like to build up my Python knowledge and apply what I've already learned about machine learning and neural networks. 

I'm also excited to work under a mentor, as I'd want to work with someone with industry experience and who I could learn about programming from in a way that might mirror my future experiences in research. ","One example of working around scheduling problems was when I acted as president of my high school's Speech and Debate team, which required a large amount of administrative work centered around scheduling practices, keeping students updated on tournaments, and organizing general informational meetings. As president, I tried to collect as much information as possible on when members were available earlier as quickly as possible, and proactively scheduled practices when attendance could be highest. I also made members aware that they should notify us in advance if they were going to be absent or tardy, and tried to create a culture of punctuality and attendance. One way that I could've improved was being more forward looking when anticipating events like holidays and finals, and rescheduling earlier on so students had more time to adjust their schedules. However, as a result of the changes implemented throughout my presidency, the Speech and Debate team saw significant improvements in attendance and tournament attendance.","One example of when I learned how to use a new library was creating the gravity simulation program that's currently visible on my Github account. After taking physics classes as a part of my Computer Engineering coursework, and applying this knowledge in classes such as ECE 35, I decided to create the project to cement what I learned. Because my Python knowledge was limited, I read the documentation for TKinter, a python GUI library, and learned how to create windows, embed Canvas objects, and populate the canvas with shapes. In order to animate the canvas, I used a recursive function that is called once every frame, which is a solution I found on Stack Overflow.

After I implemented the simulation, I realized that the code would be simpler and much more readable if I used vector mathematics, rather than calculating everything separately in terms of x and y positions, as I was previously doing. After some research, I used NumPy arrays to handle the physics of the simulation, which resulted in simpler and more elegant code. ","While all of my classes at UCSD thus far have been in Java, I've taught myself to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (such as in my Github project where I created a website), Python, and C#. I've also attended workshops and conferences for HKN and ACM consistently for the past two quarters.","Chanyoung Park, Kinnish Sathish, Anika Agrawal, Sibi Sivaram, Miles Davis, Abyuday Singh",AI,Hack,Design,5-10,4,"Independently, I've taught myself Python and am pretty comfortable coding in the language - previously, I've used libraries such as TKinter, NumPy, and MatPlotLib at various times to pursue projects that I've been interested in.

At the same time, I've researched many of the mathematical concepts around AI, especially when I took Linear Algebra and looked into practical applications of the things that I was learning. As a result, I have a high-level knowledge of different concepts in machine learning, including neural networks, backpropagation, convolutions, and loss functions. As a result, I'm interested in learning how to implement many of the concepts I've learned. Through the ACM AI projects, I aim to both fill in the gaps in my AI knowledge and extend my Python knowledge in a way that's practical and useful.","I'm interested in working on image processing and using convolutional neural networks - I've discussed these areas with friends who are taking data science and machine learning classes and am interested in expanding my knowledge in this area further. For example, I’d be interested in pursuing projects similar to those held in fall of 2021, creating CNNs for image processing and identification. 
 
I'm also interested in projects involving natural language processing, as I'm excited by the rapid growth and progress being made in this field, and am eager to gain firsthand experience to better understand the current landscape in AI. This is especially true because of my longstanding experience in Speech and Debate throughout high school and college, which has led me to be deeply interested in political science and communications. My experience in these areas leads me to be more interested in projects like the ones that ACM AI worked on in the fall of 2022, such as the Political Sentiment Classifier and Supreme Court case predictor, which bring together multiple different areas that I have experience in.

The summer after I graduated from high school, I became interested in web development and design. As a result, I decided to code a website from scratch, teaching myself about frontend web development along the way. I embedded multiple sketches created using the p5.js JavaScript library to fill the website’s contents, and taught myself how to structure the website’s contents using a basic grid layout.

Similarly, while I learned about libraries like Python TKinter that created GUIs, most of my focus was on making my GUIs functional and error-free, instead of on the design and user-friendliness of the applications I was making. I’m eager to participate in an ACM design project so that I can become more well-rounded in how I program by making applications that are both user-friendly and functional. I hope that through a Design project, I’ll be able to partially bridge the gap between what I know now, and what I’d need to know to design products and applications more similar to those I’ve seen that have been released commercially. I also hope that participating in an ACM Design project will enable me to view programming in a way that’s more artistic and creative, rather than just narrow and technical in scope, like I have up to the present.

I’m also looking for a team that’s focused on collaboration and working collectively to solve problems, as I feel that I work best in groups where everyone is actively involved in finding solutions to problems, as opposed to groups where individuals are simply assigned work and there’s little collaboration. As a result, I feel I’d work best in a group where, although we have different roles, we’re comfortable reaching out to one another to brainstorm and bounce ideas off of one another. 

In a HACK project, I’d be interested in learning more about backend development. Thus far, I’ve been able to teach myself the basics of HTML, CSS, and React.js, but I still don’t know much about backend development. As a result, throughout the course of developing a full-stack application with other students, I’d want to learn more about how backend development works.

The first would be to develop a site similar to SET evaluations, except with more functionality - for example, students might want to be able to add comments discussing the courses they’ve seen, or rate the difficulty of their coursework. 

Another would be to create a website that easily allows students to plan out their courses based on the college they’re in,  combining the functionality of the Course Planner and the Course Catalog. This website would, for example, display the available options for general education or upper division classes for a student based on what college they're in or what courses they’ve already completed.

In terms of technical skills, I would like to use this opportunity to build stronger foundations on programming languages that I am already familiar with (Python and Java), but I would also like to learn the basics and concepts of a new programming language. I would also like to use this opportunity to dive into unfamiliar topics that are a bit more intimidating to get into, such as machine learning and AI. I think the ACM projects are a very unique and a once-in-a-lifetime experience because it is a very good pivotal point to get started in an industry where experience is very heavily considered in the acceptance process. 

In terms of soft skills, I would love to experience having an industry level project be developed from beginning to end. I am also very excited to be in a team of other people who are just as passionate as I am about creating and producing an impressive work of our own. 
","Last quarter, I took an audio-visual media class (COMM 101) that was very group project heavy. I was tasked to work with the same 3 groupmates for 3 different projects throughout the quarter. 

Our first project did not have any time conflicts because we were able to knock out all of our filming and video editing in one day. However, as each project progressively increased in complexity, the second and third group projects were where a lot of our scheduling began to see issues.

Our second project was an audio story project. Since we only had one week to meet our deadline, my 3 other groupmates and I decided to divide and conquer the workload on our own since we were unable to find a time where all 4 of us could meet at the same time. We all recorded our own versions of the story and uploaded it to the group drive. Then, we would go into the editing rooms on our own time to edit what we could with what clips we had. There were positives with using this method because it allowed us to have 4 different takes of the same scene, allowing for more options when editing. And, we didn't have to find one time when all 3 of us were free. However, when editing, we came across an issue. All of our audio qualities were different, and it was sometimes obvious that the clips were from different people when listening to the edited product. 

When time came for our third group project, we took the results of our second group project into consideration and decided instead of dividing the work four ways, we would divide it two ways and have two members of the group work on the filming, and then two members of the group work on the editing. This way, the clips would not look drastically different, but all members of the group would be able to contribute equitably. This solution proved to work very effectively compared to our second project and made our final film project look seamless. Some cons however, were that the editing process felt drawn out too long because there was never a time when all 4 of us were together in the editing room at once, and so we had disagreements and overlaps with how we wanted the film to be edited. To solve this problem, what we could’ve done was to find a time, however short, to have all 4 of us in the editing room to debrief about what kinds of edits we all agree on. That way, everyone is on the same page in how the story goes. 

I definitely think that this method can be applied to other group work, especially with the ACM projects. I anticipate that there will be lots of time conflicts, as we are college students with our own busy schedules. However, by splitting the group to work in different sections of the project and meeting together occasionally to debrief and discuss project directions, we can effectively put together a flawless end product. 
","In a recent job interview for the position of a computer science instructor to young children, I was asked to give a mock lesson to the interviewer so that they could gauge my teaching style and my computer science skills. I was given a project to teach in python, with the sample code solution and a week to prepare. 

Upon seeing my task, I realized I was doomed. I hadn’t consistently coded in almost a year (after graduating high school), and I felt very rusty in python. I wasn’t confident that I could code this project without any hiccups, let alone teach it to an older interviewer. However, I knew there was nothing else I could do than to prepare to the best of my ability.  

Starting off, I viewed the output of the program and studied the sample code, breaking down each and every line to understand how each aspect of the program was being completed. For the lines of code that I did not understand, I put the line into chatGPT to explain what the function of the code was. Through this process of breaking down the sample code and understanding it line by line, I understood the material that I needed to teach. In addition to understanding the project code, I also used videos that gave a breakdown of the programming library as a supplement, ensuring that I understood the deeper inner workings of the code so that I could teach it properly. 

Eventually, I successfully taught the lesson to the interviewer. I believe an important way to show that you are a master at a skill is to be able to teach it, and so now when I try to figure out a programming language on my own, or any skill in general, I try to learn it as if I need to teach it, and this helps me significantly in learning a skill to the very foundations.

",,AI,Design,Hack,6-7,4,"AI is something that I have always found impressive. To be able to create something that can eventually become smarter than you is both very scary and exciting. However, it has also been a topic that I’ve found myself having a lot of trouble conceptually to grasp. I’ve participated in countless summer camps, workshops, classes, yet there is always something new and unknown to learn. Navigating through the world of AI and tech has always felt like a “black box” of some sort. The inner workings of how everything works has always felt barely visible. But whenever I learn something new, however small it may be, it makes me feel like I am chipping away at this intimidating world of AI. 
","I am open to all types of projects, however, I have more interest in these types in this order :

1. Recommendation systems - similar to the “tiktok algorithm” or any sort of recommendations based on the user's history 

2. AI for creativity and art, AI generated art, AI generated music, content.  

3. Computer vision projects, specifically with facial recognition/ image classification, etc
 

4. AI for education - teaching has always been best done in person, face-to-face, but how can we use AI to enhance this experience. 

5. AI for finance - fraud detection, risk assessment, etc 

6. Marketing ","Numpy, Matlab",,"Over the summer, I worked with a team of three other group members to build a small autonomous robot. We used machine learning to train the robot to detect lines and  recognize objects. The robot eventually was able to drive around a simple obstacle course consisting of cones and stop signs. I was on the team involved with the hardware of the robot, so I was in charge of connecting the wires, designing and 3D printing the base, positioning the LiDar, sensors, etc. Through this I gained a multitude of experience with the hardware aspects of robotics, however, I did not get the chance to really delve into the software of robot. I only viewed the software after my other teammate had completed it.

","Last quarter I was a mathematics tutor for a local high school, helping students struggling in math. I worked with other tutors to help create a friendly environment for students. One scheduling problem was that there was a set schedule for tutors to go to the high school using lyft codes. Since some students did not have cars, they needed to work their schedule to fit into the lyft schedule. However, there were a few students that occasionally were not able to make it to the lyft schedule due to exams. I was one of the few students that owned a car, so in order to make sure that those students that missed their day of tutoring were able to make up their weekly hours, I edited my schedule to work with their availability in order to give them rides to the school. Sometimes this meant I would be missing a few minutes of lectures, spending a longer time at the school tutoring students, or waking up early to drive students to the school at 8 am.

The approach that we took worked well, at least to an extent. For every week, we had a preset time that we would all meet to do practice rounds, and while this worked for the most part, many people simply couldn’t make it due to scheduling conflicts. Now, while most of us still benefited from the system, a more dynamic system, one which was fixed in some areas, but allowed for more flexible times and alternative appointments would have been more beneficial to the team overall.","For a final senior project in high school, I had to write a game in C# using Unity. Now, in order to do this, I obviously had to learn C#, as well as how to implement it for Unity, meaning I had to learn how the Unity libraries worked. While I first started by just learning C#, I realized that, after I got the fundamentals down, there was so much I had to learn, much of which I might never have used. Because of this, after learning a fair amount of C#, I jumped straight into the Unity libraries, which massively benefited me. I watched tutorials on how to load sprites, spent hours poring over documentation, and eventually had a working game. The main thing I learned from the experience, however, is that when learning a new programming language, rather than trying to learn it all at once, learning the basics and jumping into practice can be far more educational and productive.

I hope that by consistently working on ACM projects, I will be able to learn more about the software development cycle. I would like to learn more about the designing and building processes and how to bring project ideas to life. I have ideas that I want to try and create such as an application that can manually track your spending throughout the week, but I don’t really know where to start. The way that I thought about it was to just write about what kind of features the application would have and what the application would look like.

I’m also curious about what to do and what to look out for when deploying a completed project. I feel like when I tried to make a project, I was a little confused on how to actually make it accessible to other users who may want to test my project. In other words, I would like to learn how to build projects in such a way that it works on every user’s computer. For example, after finishing my first year in college, I decided to try and get familiar with coding from scratch by trying to create a simple task list project. When I was satisfied with what I had created, I uploaded it to Github. When I tried to download and run the project again, even though it had successfully run when I was working on the project, I ran into some problems and it wouldn’t run properly. I would like to learn how to fix this kind of accessibility problem and make it so that any user who downloads my projects can successfully run the project with no problems.

In addition, I want to learn more about the testing process. I have taken CSE 15L (Software Tools and Techniques) to learn more about debugging and I would like to learn more about how to effectively put those techniques into practice. I learned a little bit about vim and shell scripting to make running commands easier. I want to learn more about how to use debugging and scripting tools to maintain a project during the development process.","I was working on a project proposal with a team of 3 about how to enforce decarbonization at UCSD. More specifically, we had to research how we can help reduce the amount of carbon emissions that UCSD produces when using and producing energy. During this project, I had to work together with my team to schedule interviews with professionals within the field and also with each other to do more online research to write up the final project proposal.

	When we had to try and schedule an interview, our team only briefly discussed scheduling after we were able to get into contact with the professional. Luckily my team and I were able to easily schedule a day and time where we were all free. However, thinking back on it, I felt like this was a poor way to schedule something as it was very last minute and didn’t leave any room to discuss scheduling in the case where we would have any scheduling problems, like if our team’s schedule and the professional’s schedule had conflicted in some way. I think a better way to prepare for this situation would be to plan a lot earlier by discussing all the days and times that we were free before contacting the professional so that we could be certain about when we would be able to conduct the interview.

	When it came to the part where we had to work on our project proposal, I decided to try it out by contacting my team right when interviews were finished to discuss when we could meet up and start our research. During our discussion, I discovered that we had conflicting schedules that made it hard to meet up in person to work on it together. Realizing that we wouldn’t be able to meet up any time soon, we had to compromise and decide to just have an online meeting at night to work on it together while also discussing about a later date that we could meet up and finalize our proposal. I thought that this was a much more effective way to combat scheduling problems cause it gave us a heads up about the scheduling problems early. If we had waited until the last minute like last time, we would’ve had a lot less time to figure out a solution and probably would have made the scheduling process a lot messier, leading to a less organized project proposal. 

I believe that scheduling things in advance would make the development process a lot smoother and would lead to more organized and more concrete results.","One of my previous courses required that I had experience in Python, but the problem was that I had zero experience with working with that programming language at the time. But I wanted to take the class, so that meant that I had to learn the language soon if I wanted to be able to do the homework.

	One of the first things that I decided to do was to compare the Python syntax to programming languages that I was already familiar with such as Java and C++. I started by taking programs I had already written in either Java or C++ and tried to rewrite those same algorithms in Python to get more familiar with how to do simple things like defining functions, creating different data structures, and creating new objects. To solidify my understanding of the language a little more, I decided to retry past leetcode problems, but this time code up my answer in Python to kind of test my knowledge. For the things that I was unfamiliar with in terms of the new syntax or how to define new data structures, I looked at the documentation to learn more about Python data structures and their object methods.

	In addition to this, for the class, I also had to learn about Python libraries such as NumPy and PyTorch. To figure out how to use these libraries, I had to read a lot of documentation in order to understand the new methods and syntax for each library. I started with more basic methods and operations and then slowly moved to the more complex methods. For example, when I was figuring out how to use NumPy, I started by looking at the documentation about how using NumPy can make accessing matrix elements a lot easier and how it can perform matrix operations in a more compact way, like how you can multiply NumPy matrices together in one line of code. I then started learning about more complex concepts that were relevant to the class like plotting graphs based on given arrays and matrices. 

	After going through the documentation for Python, NumPy, and PyTorch, I was more prepared to take on the assignments in the class. After the class, I felt like I had a much better understanding on how to create my own Python programs. I believe that afterwards, my experience with Python had quickly reached the same skill level as Java and C++.","As a part of my coursework, I have created a file compression algorithm using C++ which can compress a text file into a binary file and add file headers and also decompress a given binary file using Huffman trees to reconstruct the compressed file. Working on this project allowed me to get more familiar with reading and writing into files on a given system. I had to create and define multiple classes and class members and had to use them together in order to successfully implement the compress and decompress features.

	I’m also working with a team of friends on a small event planning application which utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In this project, we wanted the application to allow users to create and plan future events as well as track current events. We wanted to create an application that could make planning for events a lot easier between friends and/or other people. During this project, I was working with APIs for the first time and it was also my introduction to basic web development. The main challenge was that before starting this project, we didn’t know any HTML, CSS, or Javascript, so we researched and watched numerous videos going over the fundamentals of web development. Currently, I’ve been trying to learn more about stuff like React.js and Node.js but I haven’t been able to fully understand it nor do I know how to use it yet. I figured that by working on ACM projects, I’d be able to have a mentor with me who can kind of guide me through the process of learning such technologies.

	Overall, I feel like my previous experiences have allowed me to get introduced to a wide variety of programming languages and libraries, as well as some of the basics in the development process. I believe that working on ACM projects will help me learn about the software development process in more depth, which would help me when I’m working on future projects.",,Hack,AI,Design,Around 6-8 hours,3,"I was recently exposed to the topic of computer vision, which taught me about deep learning and allowed me to work with neural networks. I thought it was really interesting how we can create an effective training model by giving the neural network training images and having it accurately classify certain objects through the form of test images. I was interested in learning more about stuff like objects and face recognition. I want to put the concepts I learned in my course into practice, and I think that working on ACM AI projects would help me get some real-life experience in working on an AI-related project.","I would be interested in working on deep learning projects since I believe that those types of projects would appeal more to my interests and past experience. Specifically, I think it’d be exciting to work on any projects that include any deep learning chatbots. I have a little bit of experience with PyTorch and would like to learn more about how to use it. I feel like the work that was done in my course was very introductory and I still don’t really understand how to create an accurate deep learning model. I feel like working on projects that work with deep learning will be both exciting and challenging at the same time.","Numpy, PyTorch, Matplotlib / Seaborn / Visualization Libraries, Matlab",,"A project I worked on was an image recognition project, where I had to create and define a neural network that had multiple convolution layers, ReLu layers, and fully-connected layers. I then had to train this neural network with training images in order to get it to successfully organize the images into different classes of objects. Finally, I tested the neural network by giving it a bunch of test images to classify, in which it did fairly accurately. In order to do this, I used my knowledge of Python, NumPy, and PyTorch. One of the challenges I had while working on this project was that in the beginning, I didn’t really get accurate results, mainly due to the fact that I didn’t fully understand the concepts of neural networks and how to successfully create a more accurate model based off of the training data. In order to combat this, I had to reread PyTorch documentation in order to understand what each method was actually doing. In order to learn more about neural networks, I read articles and watched tutorial videos about it and compared it to my program to see how I could improve it.",,,,,,,,,,,"HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git/Github","I am mainly looking for a team of people in which I can learn from but not a team full of people who are way above my skill level in such a way where any obstacles that we would encounter during the development process would be trivial for them. In other words, I want to be able to collaborate with my team by sharing ideas with each other to tackle challenges to get more experience with the typical development environment. I would also want people who seem really passionate and motivated because I feel like it would create a more exciting work environment. I think it would help me learn a lot more during the quarter if my team is also exerting the same kind of energy.

	I’m really interested in learning more about the technologies I haven’t had any prior experience with such as Node.js, React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Firebase. I want to experiment and observe how these technologies make web development a lot easier and smoother. I think that being exposed to these new technologies would really improve my skills as a developer.

	In terms of projects, I would be interested in working on web applications that can be used in everyday life such as a reminder app or a pomodoro timer, or applications that keeps things more organized such as an events scheduler or a recipe application. In addition I feel like projects that make things more accessible would be fun to work on as well.",No,,"I have a few ideas for a website that I’ve been wanting to work on but have struggled figuring out how to start such as a cost tracking application which allows users to manually input how much money they’ve spent on things in categories such as food/drinks, utilities, and miscellaneous stuff.

Another idea I had was a recipe book, which allows users to add, delete, and organize recipes where the front-end of the website is made to look like an actual recipe book, where you could flip through different recipes like flipping pages in an actual recipe book. I think it would be cool to implement a more social media aspect to it, where people can share their own recipes with other people online, all in one forum.

	Finally, another idea that I was thinking about was a website that helps list all the available classes that can be taken based on the student’s current prerequisites and major. I felt like it was a little annoying having to look at every class to see if I had completed all the prerequisites and then look to see what the class is about and then checking to see if there are available spots in such a course.

Working alongside diverse team members will not only enhance my technical abilities but also strengthen my communication and further understand the real-world implications for successful project outcomes.","I once worked in a team where I was responsible for collecting data from multiple sources, which required scheduling calls with various stakeholders. However, due to conflicting schedules, some sources were unavailable during the times I initially planned for. Recognizing this challenge, I proactively communicated with my team members to address the issue.

To effectively manage the scheduling problems, I took a step back and evaluated the situation. With the guidance of my team and reflecting on my own time management skills, I developed a plan focused on improving time management, prioritizing tasks, and adopting a growth mindset to tackle challenges.

Implementing this plan, I began organizing meetings and adjusted my approach to accommodate the availability of the sources. By prioritizing tasks based on importance and urgency, I successfully collected the necessary data within the project timeline.

Reflecting on this experience, while I was able to overcome the scheduling problems and complete my part of the project, I realize that establishing clear expectations and needs from the beginning could have streamlined the process even further. This experience taught me the importance of proactive communication and setting clear expectations to ensure smoother collaboration and efficient problem-solving in future projects.","I was introduced to Svelte during one of my classes, and I immediately recognized its value for web development, especially in comparison to traditional JavaScript frameworks. Intrigued by its efficiency and simplicity, I decided to delve deeper and explore its capabilities further.

As I gained proficiency in Svelte, I saw an opportunity to apply this knowledge to a real-world project that aligned with my interests and concerns about sustainability. I embarked on creating a website that delves into the world of second-hand clothing, shedding light on its profound implications in today's environmental landscape.

Using Svelte allowed me to streamline the development process and focus more on the content and functionality of the website rather than getting bogged down in complex code structures. Its reactive nature and component-based architecture enabled me to create dynamic and interactive features seamlessly.

Through this project, I aimed to raise awareness about the benefits of second-hand clothing, such as reducing waste and promoting sustainable consumption practices.The website showcased information about the environmental impact of fast fashion through the use of a bar chart race animation and a price comparison with expensive clothing companies and second-hand companies.

Overall, my experience with Svelte not only empowered me to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website but also reinforced my belief in using innovative tools to address contemporary issues like environmental sustainability in the digital age.","As the Lead Financial Officer for the Financial Analytics team on Compass, I have gained valuable experience in data analytics and financial analysis.

Although I have done group projects before, I believe the structure and guidance provided in ACM projects will help me learn how to more effectively work in a group. Also, I simply want to meet other students exploring computing! The second main goal I have is to learn how to use new libraries, platforms, and/or softwares to create something efficient. This spring break, for example, I started exploring SQL for fun, and found that it was so much easier to create a database with it compared to storing data in a text file (my initial and far more tedious approach).","When I was involved with Community Outreach with my robotics team for the past two academic years, scheduling was our one major issue.

We greatly valued the benefits of a physical gathering that creates a dynamic and inviting environment, facilitating better comprehension of ideas where one can swiftly sketch for clarification rather than comprehending concepts based on only verbal exchanges. Our solution was to incorporate a hybrid modality to our meetings, where we would meet online on certain days and have a physical meeting once a week and allowing those who cannot meet in person a chance to participate via voice call. While we discussed, I made sure to verbally represent the views of those who were unable to join by constantly checking the chat. By doing so, our design process greatly benefited from the creative environment created by our physical interactions without forming an unequal power dynamic where some members' views are not heard due to their absence. ","For an assignment that required the use of a laser cutter, I needed to use Inkscape to laser cut a figure pertaining to the prompt. I made the mistake of not creating an outline of my drawing on Procreate in a different color beforehand to indicate a clear distinction of where I wanted the laser cutter to cut and what I wanted it to engrave. Due to the complexity of the drawing and time constraints faced, I did not have the time to hand trace every ridge drawn. This was beyond the jurisdiction of the course-provided tutorials could teach me, and so I had to explore the different tools Inkscape provided with swiftness to find a solution. Through trial and error, I used multiple tools that I believed would have garnered the intended effect and finally found a way to create a rough outline that I was satisfied enough with and modified all the vectors the software did not place well to align with my drawing.

To address this challenge, we implemented several strategies to ensure effective collaboration and progress. Firstly, we established clear communication channels using tools like Slack and Trello to keep everyone updated on project developments and deadlines. Secondly, we divided tasks based on individual availability and skill sets, allowing team members to work on assigned tasks flexibly. Additionally, we scheduled regular check-in meetings where we could discuss progress, address any issues, and adjust timelines if necessary. Overall, I believe we handled scheduling conflicts effectively by maintaining open communication and flexibility within the team. However, in hindsight, we could have anticipated potential scheduling conflicts earlier and established a more robust contingency plan to mitigate their impact.","When working on the Economic, Agricultural, and Mental Health Analysis project, I needed to utilize MongoDB for database management, a technology I hadn't previously worked with. To learn MongoDB independently, I initially referred to online documentation and tutorials to grasp the basics of MongoDB's syntax, features, and best practices. I then set up a local development environment and experimented with simple CRUD operations to gain hands-on experience. As I encountered challenges or questions, I relied on resources like Stack Overflow and official MongoDB forums to troubleshoot and deepen my understanding. Through this self-directed learning process, I was able to effectively incorporate MongoDB into our project workflow, leveraging its capabilities to efficiently manage and retrieve data.","1.

The mechanism would get stuck often so I could've done a better job designing a more efficient model.","Learning how to code in ARM assembly language was very challenging because its syntax is very different from coding languages like Java or C.

I was also part of several class projects that also required me and my group to schedule meetings, and scheduling problems were a common occurrence. The best way to avoid these problems is to simply communicate with everyone about your availability, which includes sharing the different times throughout your week where you are available to meet and seeing which times work best for everyone. Sometimes there isn't a convenient time to meet, so the next best thing would be to communicate a possible rescheduling of a meeting. There was a specific instance where one of my project groups needed to meet at the Makerspace on the last day that it was open for the quarter, but it was also at the same time that I had a startup meeting. I didn't want to miss the startup meeting nor the project meeting, so I told the startup team about my situation and asked to reschedule to the evening. Thankfully they were all understanding, and we found a time that worked for everyone later that day, which allowed me to attend both meetings on the same day.","Figma is a design tool that I use pretty often, and for the longest time I have been self-taught. Two years ago, I took CSE 170 where I worked on a redesign of the SPIN app with 3 others, however we didn't use Figma to design our screens (we used google drawings :o). It was towards the end of the course when I learned about what Figma is and what it can be used for when another group presented the designs they made through Figma. I thought their work looked so nice and professional and I was curious about how our redesign would look like if we used Figma instead of Google Drawings. The following winter break after that Fall quarter, I worked on recreating the redesign using Figma. Some of the very basic features seemed very straightforward, such as creating shapes, text, and laying things out to create something that resembles a page of an app. Despite only knowing these basic features, the screens that I made already looked 10x better than the original screens we made on Google drawings. I became more curious about what other things are possible with Figma, so I checked out some projects from people within the Figma community. During this time, I learned about frames and auto-layout which was a gamechanger for me. I worked on a personal project where I utilized frames and auto-layout, which made the whole wireframing process feel so much smoother than manually placing elements on a rectangle background. From there, I really just learned more about Figma through my own curiosity and my motivation to get better with the tool.","For the startup that I am in, I am part of the design systems team where I helped defined our app's typography, color system, and margin rules. I also contributed to making some of the app's components, including a single/multi select window and a text input box.

I would like to take a more hands-on role in the timeline and the implementation of big ideas.","An example of when I have been on a team and worked around scheduling problems was during my data science projects class. To do an effective job of scheduling meetings, the first thing I did was send out a when-to-meet for everyone to fill out. This would allow me to figure out what times worked best for everyone on the team so we could work or even just give updates during those times. Unfortunately, not everyone could meet during that 1-hour session but we found a couple of times that worked best for people and they served as work periods where we could work with each other. We also included weekly updates in our Discord channel so everyone could update each other on issues that were being fixed. Something that we could have done better was not stick to static meetings and just have weekly meetings on different days so more people could attend meetings at the same time. In addition, there should have been more accountability on who was attending meetings since it was very difficult to keep track of.","An example of when I figured out how to use a certain library was when I learned how to use OpenCV for machine learning purposes. Coming into a research team, I didn't have any previous experience in artificial intelligence or machine learning, thus, I was walking into my project completely blind. The first thing I did to keep up with my research team was doing research online by looking at YouTube videos on OpenCV and Git Hub for repositories I could learn from. Specifically, I looked online for ways that I could apply OpenCV and simple projects other students had made. Finally, I did a hands-on project to apply what I learned online in a simple way to double-check my understanding. In this case, I made an image recognition code to understand how models are trained. After all of these steps, I felt confident in my ability to apply OpenCV to a larger machine-learning project.","I have done Hack Projects before where I made a Course Builder for UCSD students so they could visualize their schedules.

I found that this actually was a blessing, because the more things I had to fit on my schedule, the more productive I became out of sheer necessity.  Suddenly, this problem of being busy all the time became something so positive, and it was all do to perspective. So, I know that I am able to be a team player even if there are scheduling problems since I can look at things with a positive point of view rather than a negative one.","While a simple task like filling a car with gas may be menial and insignificant, when I was 16 years old and just learning how to drive, it seemed like a very daunting task. Usually, for all things driving, my parents would teach me anything that I needed to know. But one day, they were both at work and the car was on empty, so I needed to figure it out on my own. When I got to the gas station and unscrewed the opening to the tank, I was so nervous. It felt like everyone around me knew that I was taking too long, and that I had no idea what I was doing. While the task itself was relatively simple, the nervousness of having to do it without any guidance while out in public made my stomach turn. I selected the regular gas option and slowly put the nozzle in the tank opening. It all was going smoothly so far, but when I tried to lock the nozzle so that I wouldn't have to hold on to it the whole time, it wasn't working and the gas kept stopping its flow. This was so frustrating because at this point, it felt like I had been there for so long, and like I was holding up a line. Eventually, after several tries, I finally got it to work and the rest went smoothly. While this is an everyday task that everyone eventually has to do, the process of learning how to pump gas for the first time on my own felt like an accomplishment.

In order to work around this issue, we split up our updates by having some of us meet with one executive board member at a certain time while the other board member and executive board member could meet at a separate time to discuss updates and work through tasks that we needed to complete together.

","During my Software Engineering internship last summer, I needed to learn how to use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) very well and understand how the Cloud works in order to complete my project since I needed to extract specific data from GCP and deploy it as a JSON. I also needed to run my program as a Cloud Function automatically using Cloud Scheduler on GCP since it would automate my program and decrease the time and cost of running the program for developers to utilize. I learned how to use GCP on my own by conducting research, testing smaller programs, and understanding the JSONS of the datasets that I would be extracting from. I started by looking up the cloud functionalities on Google as well as pseudocode online to understand how exactly GCP and features like Cloud Function and Cloud Scheduler work. Then, I went to the specific data that I needed from a sample user and analyzed the JSON data and initially tried to extract the data command-line before using REST APIs to extract the data.

The program automated the storage of recommendations into JSON files and a designated GCP bucket and sent the quantity of recommendations across different types (clusters, IAMs, instances, services) for each project and a link to the GCP bucket to slack. The project runs as a Cloud Function to save costs and utilizes Cloud Scheduler to automatically run once a week. The project will be extended to Azure and AWS Cloud environments.

My project in this company taught me a lot about the cloud, data extraction, and allowed me to enhance my programming skills. Working on this project allowed me to think not just abou programming and learning about the different platforms, but I also had to improve the algorithm design of my program to have the fastest runtime since it involved a lot of data extraction from several accounts. My project will be extremely useful as it will increase the security of the cloud and save the company a lot of money because developers will remember to take action on the recommendations which saves money. I felt that my contribution was extremely valuable to the company since saving costs is crucial for start-up companies and securing their cloud ensures their product is stronger and more marketable. This project was a great experience as it allowed me to get a more real-world application of Computer Science as I got to delve into programming, software tools, and collaboration.",,,,,,,,,,,"HTML, CSS, Git/Github","I am looking for a team that is highly motivated and passionate about computer science and truly interested in software development. I thrive in collaborative and interactive environments so I would like to work with a team who likes to work in teams and bounce off of each other's ideas. 

In terms of specific interests, I really want to gain experience with Node.js, React.js, and Express.js since these frameworks are used in a lot of CS projects and  internships in software. I have some web development experience, but I am looking to develop more expertise in web development. As a Business minor, I really want to develop my software skills to be strong enough so that I can eventually start my own company. Web development is an important skill to have when thinking about starting a company and selling a product since e-commerce and online advertising is crucial to a successful company. I understand design as well since I am actively collaborating with a Cognitive Science student on the User Interface of an app using Figma which I develop back-end in order to understand the optimal design in my current research project based on the context of who will use my application. This applied in web development as well since the website needs to tailor to the target consumer. I also have design experience with Wix and HTML websites, but I want to advance these basic skills. 

Overall, I want to develop my web development skills and expand on my current experience. I have always wanted to learn MERN Stack and I am confident that ACM Hack will help me gain experience in it.   ",No,,"One idea I had for a website is a smaller social media platform that is specifically meant for e-commerce, similar to facebook marketplace but with a better UI and easier verification of and communication with sellers. The website will ideally allow users to search up products their looking for in their area and it should filter out based on that. I also wanted to implement categories and filtering based on price points and quality of item. I think this website would be useful for college students moving into apartments looking for furniture or people trying to sell old items. It should allow for people to create an account to sell or to buy so that users can message sellers and vice versa. 

Another website idea I had was a travel itinerary generator website where users could enter information about a trip they would like to go on and other information such as budget, location, and dates. Based on the information provided, the website would generate a travel itinerary with flight tickets, hotel tickets, and activities for each day along with tickets for activities that require it. This makes things a lot easier for people who travel as they will have a general outline of places to visit and things to do in a new area. The activities recommended could also be based on reviews and popular places at the intended vacation location. ",Yes,Yes,Female,Asian,Spring 2024
4/2/2024 20:36:38,yuy080@ucsd.edu,Yuan-Kai Yang,kvnyang,1st year,https://docs.google.com/document/d/11rQJ1yUa6RyUUJbomHkHA2f5-htAGsQ-ABFVXKRaBvY/edit?usp=sharing,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuan-kai-yang,No,No,"The two categories of skills I would like to further develop through ACM projects are individual and collaborative and individual.

In terms of individual skills, I believe that both my character skills and technical skills will drastically improve if given the opportunity to take part in an ACM project. I have never been part of a self-motivated computer science project outside of an academic setting, so having this opportunity will be a game-changer for the trajectory of my college career as a CS student. With this project, I know that I will have to do a lot of self-learning, which I haven't done too much in terms of Computer Science. I will be more proficient in picking up new libraries, languages, etc. which would definitely boost both my technical skills and my skill of resourcefulness or independence. I know that ACM supports its members greatly from the events I've attended, so I trust that ACM will be able to guide my team's project down a path that we'll be proud of.

In terms of collaborative skills, I think that the main goal of ACM Projects is to learn how to work with multiple people trying to achieve a greater goal. By being assigned to a group of potential strangers, I feel like it would be good exposure to being thrown into an actual workplace. I will see how different parts of a project come together through communication. I will be able to understand how different strengths and weaknesses can mend together to create a mighty team. I want to develop my collaborative skills through ACM Projects.","In my ENG 10 class in Fall '23, we had a final group project that lasted a good 3-4 weeks. I was chosen as the group facilitator, where I would organize the structure of the project and schedule times to work on the project. Not going to lie, it was difficult trying to line up 4 schedules of college students who have prior commitments and even more commitments coming up. The way I handled this was to either set a deadline for a certain task or keep budging the group for times we could meet up.

I set up deadlines for a task and allocated responsibilities (ex. please finish the base of the CAD design by Friday) so that my group mates could finish work on their own time. That way, the group didn't face the obstacle of not being able to move forward onto the next step of the project and it didn't inconvenience us all. 

If the group really needed to meet up, I would either schedule a time to meet up in person, schedule a time to meet up over Zoom, or create a collaborative Google Doc for the entire team to put their inputs in. For example, to choose the product we wanted to design, we had to boil down all of our ideas into one idea. The challenge here was that it was the start of Thanksgiving break, so it wouldn't have been realistic to meet up and discuss this. What I did was create a shared Google Doc where everyone pitched 3-4 ideas and we then started eliminating ideas that were unreasonable or not agreed upon. In one day we were able to come to a conclusion and have the product of our final project selected.

I think that I could have done a better job by collecting the class times of my groupmates and trying to schedule something that lined up with that. My mistake was just asking each day about availability when I could have just created a shared Google Calendar.","Before starting my first quarter here at UCSD, I knew that I would have to understand the fundamentals of Python. So, I dedicated a large chunk of the latter half of my senior year in high school and summer to learning Python. I used any resource I could find. From W3Schools to Sololearn, I scoured the internet for free resources to learn Python. I had no prior experience and no one around me even knew about the world of computing. It was just me and my computer against the world. I was dedicated to learning the material. I spent at least 2 hours a day just going through Python courses, looking at documentation, watching YouTube videos, and experimenting on my own. At one point, I even found the Stepik textbook for UCSD, so I went through that to learn Python. To test my mastery, I would do Leetcode questions as kind of a quiz or mini-project. This paid off in my UCSD CS Summer Program (SPIS) and my CSE 8A class, where I was confident and did well. 

I know that I am resourceful and the internet is so vast that I could learn anything that I wanted to. I am truly interested in computer science and computing in general, so I know that I would be ecstatic to learn more about new tools in computing and have an intrinsic motivation to not only familiarize myself with it but master it.","Even though I have only reached CSE 12 by this quarter, I do believe I have skills that are notable at this point in time. For example, I've contributed to a team to build an HTML/CSS website for a program. Even though it was just purely for aesthetics, I do believe that I have a good intuition for front-end web design. We even won a 1st place award for the website competing against 20 other teams of students. Another example is my machine learning project that I did with a peer in the summer of 2023. We built a shoe recognition AI that used computer vision to identify shoes and categorize them as Nike or Adidas shoes.

Even though I may not have too many skills, I am adamant about trying out new things and honing the skills as best I can. ",,Hack,AI,Design,10,5,"It goes without saying that AI is the most hot topic in the world of computing right now. I would like to get my foot in the door of AI through ACM. I have already attended ACM AI School and loved my experience, so I would like to further my experience through an ACM AI Project.

Compared to Hack and Design, AI is the most foreign field of the three to me. I want to use the skills I learn from the ACM AI Project to lilypad onto my own projects. I want to learn the fundamentals of AI of compartmentalizing data and fine-tuning the model, so it seems like a no-brainer for me to join something like this. On top of the development of my technical skills, this will be the first time in my CS career that I will be working in a team larger than 2 people. I will be able to further my collaborative and people skills. Through this AI Project, I will be able to broaden my horizons. I want to discover how AI is used to predict, assist, and make life easier and better for humans. ","I would say I'm pretty much a novice at AI, but I am interested in computer vision. I have some experience with computer vision in a past project, so I won't be coming in completely blind. However, I would be open to learning more about other ways AI could be applied to problems. For example, I want to explore how AI works with numeric data like in stock market predictors and such.","Numpy, Matplotlib / Seaborn / Visualization Libraries","I've taken part in AI School with ACM. There, we learned about the fundamentals of AI and Python libraries such as Numpy and PyTorch. I don't think I fully mastered these skills, but I have had exposure to them through ACM.","In the summer of 2023, I created an AI project alongside a partner that would use computer vision to recognize and categorize shoes. It was pretty basic, just categorizing a shoe based on if it was a Nike or Adidas shoe. We learned how to use ResNet50, TensorFlow, and MatPlotLib throughout the project. I contributed in the model deployment and data processing of it all. I couldn't tell you what every line of code meant, but I could give a high-level overview of it. Because of this project, I would like to do another project where I can keep on building on my AI skills through trial and error.","I'm very excited to be considered for this, thank you for giving me this opportunity!",,,,,,,,,,"HTML, CSS, JavaScript","Just like everyone else, I'm looking for a team that is consistent and dedicated to the project. I feel like a committed team is a given quality. On top of that, I'm looking for a team that is creative in problem-solving. I know this project will be a difficult task to undertake, but with enough creative problem-solving, we would be able to reach our goals. I'm looking for teammates that don't surrender when they can't beat an obstacle. I value people who are headstrong in getting around, above, under, or through obstacles by any means possible. Perseverance is the main quality that sums up these wants that I have for a team.

Some interests I hold are education, movies, and social media. Now, I don't have a strong idea of what I would want to do, but I know I will be 110% committed to it. For example, I would like to make something like LetterBoxd for television shows to let people rate TV Shows. Or, I would like to make an educational game that makes learning math, history, or even computer science even more fun. I want to create a website that is engaging and needed in the world. ",Yes,https://github.com/yuankaiy/hackschool-fa23,"As mentioned above, a TV show rating website would be fun. It would act like a social media platform where users have a feed and an ever-expanding catalog of TV shows that they rate. To further that, it would then recommend other shows for users to watch. Another project idea mentioned above is the educational game website. Inspired by Khan Kids, it would be geared toward primary school-level students to teach basic concepts through games. I would even pitch the idea of expanding on the Fall '23 Hack School game of typing and adding more features, like profiles and such.

While I have some basic foundational knowledge in these areas, I hope to delve deeper and broaden my knowledge. 
During the duration of the project, I want to focus on bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical applications of the skills I have acquired thus far in the Data Science courses I have taken (DSC 10, DSC 20 and now DSC 30). I would like to leverage my existing coding skills and cultivate new ones. Although I have honed my design skills in UI/UX, graphic design throughout high school (mainly Figma and Adobe Illustrator), I would like to improve and apply them to tangible outcomes within real-world projects. 
I am also eager to embrace collaborative teamwork, while valuing diverse perspectives. I wish to refine my communication and interpersonal skills, and am looking forward to enriching myself with invaluable skills that go beyond the four walls of a classroom. ","During my tenure as Director of my high school's technology club, scheduling conflicts among the members of my team was a common occurrence. Initially, these conflicts led to procrastination and last minute rushes that would often result in us pulling all-nighters that proved to be rather inefficient. Over time, I figured out better strategies such as dividing team members into smaller subgroups based on their respective tasks, facilitating easier coordination and scheduling. For larger group meetings, I found it has always been helpful to create a clear agenda with approximate timestamps. This ensured that our meetings remained focused and concise, minimizing time wastage. ","One example of when I figured out how to use a tool on my own was when I participated in the inductions of my school's technology club's Design department. Despite lacking prior experience in design, I tackled the challenge of mastering Adobe Illustrator from scratch. Through extensive dedication, which involved hours of watching YouTube tutorials, scouring design resources, and countless failed attempts, I was eventually able to draw a digital portrait of Draco Malfoy, my favorite character from the Harry Potter series.
A more recent demonstration of my self-learning capabilities took place when I enrolled in a Data Science workshop last quarter. Despite facing a significant setback due to illness, which prevented me from attending classes for nearly two weeks, I refused to be deterred. Recognizing the absence of recorded sessions, I turned to resources such as YouTube and various tech websites to grasp the fundamentals of implementing projects in Text Processing and Audio Processing on JupyterHub, utilizing libraries like NumPy.
Through these experiences, I have come to appreciate the effectiveness of trial and error as a means of genuinely comprehending complex tasks, despite its time-consuming nature.","Although I lack extensive coding experience, my knowledge has significantly advanced over the past two quarters through my enrollment in DSC 10 and 20. Seeking to further enhance my skills, I enrolled in DSC 96, a Workshop in Data Science, where I delved into projects utilizing JupyterHub. Among the projects I engaged in, the Taylor Swift Song Recommender stands out as my favorite. This project involved recommending songs based on various metrics such as acousticness, volume, tempo, and time stamps. Additionally, I found great interest in the Text Processing project, where I developed a driving question, conducted Sentiment Analysis on specific textual data, and drew insightful conclusions. This project involved cleaning and filtering data, counting word frequency, and tokenizing using NLTK.","Ishita Takkar, Ishaan Gosain, Divyaansh Verma",AI,Design,Hack,8-10,4,"I want to be part of ACM AI Projects because I'm fascinated by Artificial Intelligence and how it can change the world.

I began by reading through the extensive official Matplotlib documentation. I concentrated on illustrations that were directly relevant to the kinds of visualizations I wished to produce. I experimented gradually, changing the labels and axes, adding interactive components, and experimenting with various plot kinds.

I remember using a heatmap to illustrate dataset associations. There were a few examples in the documentation, but none of them quite matched my needs. Thus, in order to create the heatmap with the precise color scheme and annotations needed, I merged the logic from several examples.

There was a lot of trial and error involved in the iterative process. I used to routinely consult Stack Overflow threads, but solely to gain insight into mistakes or unexpected results; I never looked for exact answers there. Finally, I was able to create a number of well-received, in-depth, and educational visualizations.

Secondly, we held regular stand-up meetings to quickly address any scheduling conflicts and reallocate resources as needed. This agility allowed us to maintain momentum despite unexpected challenges.

However, reflecting on the experience, I believe there were areas for improvement. One aspect is enhancing the forecasting of potential scheduling conflicts. Proactively identifying and addressing these conflicts could have minimized disruptions. Additionally, fostering a more flexible work environment could have allowed team members to contribute more effectively around their schedules, particularly for tasks that didn't require synchronous collaboration.

Overall, I believe the project was a success due to our collective effort to overcome scheduling obstacles. Yet, adopting a more anticipatory approach to scheduling conflicts and promoting flexibility in work arrangements could have further optimized our efficiency and productivity.","During my time as a Software Engineer with SEDS@UCSD, I undertook the significant task of developing a Data Acquisition and Solenoid Control system for the Nephas rocket engine, which necessitated a deep integration of hardware and software for real-time sensor data management via CAN Bus. This project required the implementation of MQTT, a messaging protocol I was unfamiliar with at the start. To master MQTT, I dived into official documentation and leveraged online resources, tutorials, and community forums, such as Stack Overflow and GitHub, for practical insights and troubleshooting. Engaging in hands-on experimentation, I set up a local MQTT broker to understand the protocol's fundamentals, including topics and the publish-subscribe model. The integration phase was critical, as I worked to ensure MQTT's seamless operation with our Python backend and React.js GUI frontend, focusing on the accurate translation of MQTT messages into control commands and data display. Debugging and performance optimization were continuous, utilizing tools like Wireshark for monitoring message flows. This self-driven learning experience underscored the importance of self-reliance in mastering new technologies and has continued to influence my approach to software engineering challenges.","In addition to my core technical skills, my experiences with NASA and Triton Software Engineering have significantly broadened my technical horizon and leadership capabilities, equipping me with a unique blend of expertise and insights. At NASA, through the L’SPACE NWPEE Program, I was a Sensor Research Engineer where I contributed to a proposal project focused on Terrain Identification through Motion Pattern Recognition. This project aimed at mapping terrains without relying on traditional LIDAR or camera technology, showcasing my ability to innovate and apply programming skills in novel contexts. Furthermore, my role as a Computer Hardware Engineer in the NASA Mission Concept Academy allowed me to contribute to developing a mission concept that utilized asteroid data for trajectory tracking, highlighting my skills in data analysis and system design.

At Triton Software Engineering, I served as Product Manager, where I devised software scaling strategies for a non-profit app, significantly enhancing its capacity to handle increased user traffic. This role not only demonstrated my technical proficiency in software development and front-end design but also my project management and leadership skills. My involvement in these projects at NASA and Triton Software Engineering showcases my adeptness at working within highly technical teams, my capability to lead and innovate in project development, and my commitment to contributing meaningful advancements in technology. These experiences reflect my diverse technical skill set, from software development to hardware engineering and project management, making me a versatile candidate for projects that require a deep understanding of technology and an innovative approach to problem-solving.","Kesav Bobba, Siddartha Nair, Akhilendra Nair",AI,Hack,Design,10,5,"Participating in ACM AI Projects represents a unique opportunity for me to immerse myself in the cutting-edge world of artificial intelligence, an area that has always fascinated me due to its transformative potential across various domains.

I want to deepen my understanding of the AI development process, learn more about common tools used by AI engineering teams, and be able to create more complex and useful stuff to eventually open a start-up company with a focus on AI education (very relevant to my current research project) or AI applications in Finance & Business (depending on the market demand). The ACM's AI Projects seem to be very useful and interesting to learn this craft. Because this kind of work cannot be done by one person, I also want to gain more experience working with my peers in a more relaxed and creative environment instead of a stressful and constrained one like in CSE courses.  ","For my current ERSP research project (a one-year-long apprenticeship), our team prefers to work independently due to our busy schedules. Consequently, there were numerous instances where some team members had to shoulder more than 25% of the workload. In terms of workload scheduling, I found myself responsible for nearly half of our research project proposal during finals week. It was the last week of the Fall 2023 quarter, and there was very big pressure to fix our proposal in a very short timeframe. Recognizing that my schedule was slightly lighter (with only 2 finals instead of 3 like the rest of my group), I committed an additional 20 hours (despite the 6 hours officially required) during finals week, resulting in a significant grade improvement from no pass to high pass. Thus, I suppose my approach to scheduling problems is an individual sacrifice for the team's benefit.

Regarding time scheduling, I must admit I am a night owl and dislike morning meetings. During winter break, our team had very busy schedules, necessitating 9 a.m. meetings weekly. Despite struggling to drag myself out of bed, I still attended every single meeting, although my focus was slightly off due to sleep deprivation. I believe this is an area where I could certainly improve myself.","Before starting my current research project, I had no practical experience with Python, HTML, and CSS. To address that, I self-taught these tools using free online resources like freecodecamp and YouTube over the winter break. Then, I completed two projects to test my skills: I developed a simple static website page for my mom's piano studio (using CSS and HTML), and built an emotion detector app using Watson Library and Flask.

Also, for a very long time, I avoided systematic debugging due to excessive confidence in the ""what if I just look at my code long enough"" method. It worked until I encountered projects in CSE100. That's when I actually learned how to use debugging tools like C++'s gdb and valgrind with just the documentation and tedious trial and error method. But now I know how to use them properly.","My current ERSP research project involves working with OpenAI's GPT-4 and experimenting with improving its mathematical abilities (via the use of formal mathematics like Lean and Coq) and applications in STEM education. Particularly, three other ERSP scholars and I are working on developing an AI Tutor for CSE 21 with Professor Lerner. In June, we will present our poster, and in the summer, we might write a research paper about our tool (if we have time). My biggest contribution was brainstorming new approaches and functionalities for our tool and actively creating new directions whenever our team gets stuck. If you are interested in the details, I can provide the research proposal PDF.

My previous personal project involved creating a simple web app that can analyze text for emotional context using Watson Library (IBM AI) and Flask (Python framework). I am also taking CSE150B (AI Search and Reasoning Algorithms) and will be working on quite a few interesting Python + AI micro-projects for this class. With that said, I will be gradually improving my AI skills and be able to contribute to my project team with new ideas and technical skills. Other than that, I pretty much self-learned web dev tools.

I also completed an in-class C++ project with my two other classmates during my time at Orange Coast College (before transferring to UCSD). I volunteered to be a team leader because it was an excellent opportunity to take responsibility for other programmers: a valuable skill in software development. Being a team leader, I effectively planned the division of the project into subparts between group members, fixed my mates' code, and presented the final version on time. Taking this responsibility, I learned the importance of precise planning and, most importantly, working in a group.

I believe that we did a somewhat effective job through this, although I think that there are things that we could have done better. In my opinion, I feel that there could have been more detail in specifying on the changes we made as well as leaving more detailed comments within the code itself. These are things that I plan to address better in the future.","I wanted to make a basic map as a beginning step towards a GUI for the Pokémon game that my friend and I were programming. The biggest struggle that I had with this was with where to start, as this was something I had never done before. Looking around on the Internet, I found an example that was fairly similar to what I was looking for. It had a basic map using Java swing and awt, which I used as a basis for my map. After looking through the code to try to understand it, I tested around to create a map that could move a character around a map. I implemented collision detection, and this serves as the initial part of the program. This uses a ProcessBuilder to compile and run another class when there is a collision.","Over the summer, I worked on a robotics project as a part of a program, which gave me the opportunity to learn and work with various things like raspberry pi. This was a great experience for me to better understand how to use other things like motors, servos, ultrasound sensors, and cameras.

Not only were there conflicts with the timings between the schools and the staff we were working with, but we also had to schedule around our own school timings, other extracurriculars, and personal events. I believe I did an effective job working around such conflicts by communicating with all members and collecting information on various times that they were free. Then, I was able to pick one of those times for each school and also compromise by moving around some of my own events when needed.","Examples of how I figured out something by myself are mostly related to learning programming languages. For example, when I wanted to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I completed an online course that introduced people to these languages along with small projects.

I want to be able to take initiative and be the person that my team can rely on and turn to when they need.,An example was when I worked on a project in Design Co which required checkpoints to be completed in a timely and orderly fashion. There were many times where we had scheduling conflicts and we couldn't complete the tasks we were assigned together. Our task was to create a hi-fi prototype of our app but we couldn't have everyone work on it at the same time because either some people had classes or they couldn't fit it into their schedule. We delegated work to each person that had to complete it by a specific deadlines and we checked in on each other to make sure that we were doing the work on time. I think we did a good job of splitting up the word into equal parts for everyone but I think that we could have done a better job in working together as in joining a zoom and collaborating because that way we could have made a more cohesive hifi prototype. ,I figured out how to use pandas just from reading up on it on the internet and watching videos on people demonstrating how pandas is used.

I competed in a competition within this club with a team called Civil Structures and had to create a bridge with specifications that we had to beat. Being in high school we all had our own clubs and sports outside of MESA which made it somewhat more difficult because we were all pretty busy. To work around the busyness we each sacrificed a day in our week despite any conflicting schedule to get the work done. I believe that this was effective because I believe that sometimes sacrifice is needed to succeed. I think we could have done a better job by coordinating with the team with more flexibility, because we strictly had that one day of the week to work on it, however I believe switching it around every week between days would have allowed us to not be so heavily sacrificing one specific day, but instead change days and be able to attend to all our clubs in a balanced way.","In one of my computer science classes, C was not taught to us.

During the Winter Quarter, I participated in Design Co. Studio where our group focused on designing a virtual try-on experience. We encountered challenges with scheduling due to conflicting availability, compounded by weekly assignment deadlines, which occasionally hindered effective communication. Despite these obstacles, I took the initiative to initiate solutions and address the issues at hand. I think as a group we could have primarily reinstated the rules we set for each other at the beginning of the Design Co. Studio Course. It would have ultimately helped if we were more organized and if we had followed the standards that we had set for each other. ","As a newcomer to Figma, I've encountered challenges navigating the program independently, primarily due to uncertainty about what to create. I believe that working in a group environment with a defined project would facilitate idea sharing and collaboration, leveraging the collective creativity of the team. Despite these hurdles, I've managed to explore certain features of Figma on my own and have actively sought out tutorials and resources to overcome initial complexities. While I still find myself occasionally feeling lost, I'm enthusiastic about learning and honing my skills in Figma to unleash my creativity. One specific instance where I faced a learning curve was when I delved into understanding vectors within the Figma environment.","While I'm relatively new to Figma, my enthusiasm for UX design is strong, and I'm eager to expand my skills in this area.

Since high school, I've always been interested in the tech and design fields, but coming into college, I was a bit lost because I never had the strongest resources to help me build the skills I needed. This ultimately made me lack confidence when applying to programs and jobs that related to the things I wanted to do because I was scared that I lacked the skills needed to be able to do the task given to me.

","My recent experience in COGS 123 was definitely a wake-up call in creating effective scheduling strategies and working with a team to employ these strategies effectively. For context, COGS 123 is a quarter-long project-based class focused on social computing, where the entire quarter is spent nursing and developing a social computing prototype, 10-minute presentation, and portfolio entry to be delivered at the end of the quarter. Initially, our team went about collaborating in a very lax manner-- however, as all of our team members took on more and more commitments throughout the quarter, we all became very busy and scheduling meetings to test our social computing prototype became increasingly difficult. In short, we recognized that we sabotaged ourselves and needed to create a strategy to ensure our project's completion. We recognized that a lot of the work we would need to do would fall through the cracks if we didn't have a way to keep track of them. In recognizing this, we created checklists for each phase of our project, so each team member could work on parts of the project asynchronously. This allowed us to keep making progress on our project without needing to meet in person. This approach, of course, was made possible by using tools like Slack and Discord, which allowed us to communicate with one another in an organized fashion. In addition to this, when we did find a time that worked for all of us, we made sure to hold ourselves accountable and maintain an open line of communication to make sure that we would show up to our agreed time and make valuable use of it. Our team ended up doing fairly well on this project, which stands as a testament to the effectiveness of our strategy. This being said-- I feel like my main takeaway from this experience was the importance of preparation, and how it is important to create these strategies prior to incredibly busy sections of work in order to lessen stress that pops up further down the line.","Over the summer, I taught myself how to use Figma, which I found to be much easier than I expected. I found that online tutorials were immensely helpful in creating the foundation needed to use the program effectively.

This was also the time when I was filling out college applications, still adjusting to the US education system since I had shifted here from India at the end of my junior year in high school, and had the highest course load, packed with APs. Oftentimes, I would have to send out emails or announcements to the students in the district debate teams and even the parents, update content, manage communication regarding location and time of mock debate sessions at a very short notice. Hence, I would draft emails and announcement and be looking over some content for future debate sessions during my classes in school which would result in me falling behind a little. However, I decided to be transparent with all my teachers regarding that and worked around it, often completing the school work at odd hours on the weekends when I didn't have other debate commitments. Since I was in charge of managing all the debate teams in the district, I would also have to take up other's responsibilities if they were not completed in time to ensure smooth functioning.","As a first-year data science student, I encountered a situation where I independently learned and applied a new library in Python for a class project.

At first, we used a simple rule based classifier to categorize the tweets, but due to a low accuracy  (70%), we switched to a machine-learning based classifier. This time we were able to achieve an accuracy of 90% with a logistic regression model. We showcased our work with a final presentation, receiving positive feedback from other mentors, parents, and students from the program. This invaluable experience not only advanced my coding skills in python and java but also taught me the significance of collaboration,  potential of AI, and enhanced my problem-solving skills.

setback a delay would cause. It also helps us block and unblock dates for events and officer meetings. Finally, once dates got finalized, I developed a fixed schedule that will only change in the case of a crucial emergency. Then, I made a reminder system that would keep everyone in check of what was happening when. This procedure promoted organization and commitment within the officer-advisor group, which grew into a very successful club.  
One thing I could have done better was to start this calendar procedure earlier which could have saved more time for the more engaging and fun club event which would have publicized our club.

As a brand new event, REGIUM required meticulous planning from the ground up. Over four months, my team and I tackled a diverse range of tasks, from designing competition rounds to training volunteers, coordinating judges, securing participation from other schools, and managing tight timelines and budgets.

This leadership role coincided with my rigorous studies for the JEE, a highly competitive entrance exam in India. Effectively juggling these demanding commitments was crucial. I implemented a strict schedule, allocating dedicated time slots for each activity. This focus ensured I could give my full attention to the task at hand, minimizing distractions.

Open communication was paramount. I kept the team informed of my other commitments and ensured everyone remained on the same page through a detailed collaborative project planner. This approach allowed team members to seamlessly pick up slack even if they couldn't attend every meeting.

More specifically, I would like to improve my proficiency with artificial intelligence, which I am greatly interested in. Additionally, I would like to gain a more profound understanding of frameworks such as TensorFlow with a mentor and a group of peers to collaborate, as I have self-studied artificial intelligence so far.

Beyond technical proficiency, I would also like to improve the practicality of my projects. While I have done several projects in the past, they often had little practicality in real-world applications. I wish to work on projects that will allow me to attempt tackling real-world problems to improve my ability to critically think, evaluate plausible solutions, as well as adjust methods according to feedback and results.

Communication skills are another area I would like to prioritize. The ability to convey complex ideas clearly and concisely, both verbally and in writing, is a skill that I must develop as I continue to study in the field of data science and I have little experience in working on group projects in this field. I see that there is a constant necessity to communicate in various contexts with both peers and mentors, and I believe that being challenged and gaining such experience will be a great opportunity to enhance my communication skills.","In high school, I was a co-founder and vice-president of a club focused on teaching middle and high school students basic Java. During this, we encountered various challenges while planning classes with my teammates, especially with the quickly growing size of the club and limited manpower. Our team employed several strategies to effectively manage these scheduling obstacles and ensure the smooth operation of our club.

Firstly, we recognized the importance of establishing clear communication channels to keep everyone informed. We created a shared online calendar where my team could indicate their availability for club meetings to plan. This allowed us to identify common times and schedule meetings without absences.

Furthermore, we decided to share several documents for various documentations, everything from the class topics, points of interest of the students, topic progression, as well as attendance, which made it easier for us to explain the work that was being done to middle school staff that gave permission for the club.

Despite our efforts to navigate scheduling challenges effectively, there were certainly areas where we could have improved. For instance, implementing a feedback system and being more flexible so that we could arrange the schedule of the sessions with the students better in case of special circumstances such as holidays or school events could’ve allowed us to progress further and provide better results.","One example where I independently learned a new library was when I started studying the topic of AI. As I was first getting into the field of AI, I was eager to explore deep learning, and TensorFlow stood out to me as a good starting point with its widespread use and easy access. Initially, I was intimidated by the broad ecosystem of TensorFlow, but I managed to familiarize myself through a series of steps.

I started by attempting to learn straight from the TensorFlow documentation, from which I, unfortunately, learned very little as I did not understand most of the content, from both being a complete beginner and the documentation being less beginner-friendly. Subsequently, I turned to YouTube tutorials and personal blogs that many professionals kindly provided online and quickly familiarized myself with the basics of neural networks and deep learning concepts. Although not perfectly, I managed to grasp a firm idea of the theoretical foundation of machine learning and the role of the TensorFlow framework. Then, I turned to the TensorFlow documentation, which I could understand much better. I slowly worked through the examples such as various MNIST datasets and cifar datasets, gaining hands-on experience with building and training neural networks using TensorFlow's high-level APIs.

As I progressed, I continued to face challenges, but at a certain point, I was able to search for most of my problems on sites such as Stackoverflow and solve the issues. Although I am yet to call myself proficient in the library as there are so many functionalities that I have not explored, it is one of the moments where I managed to utilize a complex library by myself.","Most of my projects are available in Github, but they are largely unorganized in the youngpark repository and are in the process of slowly being organized. The two most recent projects that I have done are in “Project” and “Optimizer_Simulation” repositories, which are on image manipulation through kernels and simulating optimizers from scratch, respectively. The image kernel project was an extension of the final projects of DSC20 and DSC96 and the optimizer simulation was an extension of my extended essay I wrote in high school in IB. The code and process are commented on and documented in Git Hub.

Some other projects aren’t organized in my Github but are organized in some way, which are also on my resume with more detail.

In “Resource-efficiently Simulating Simple Physics Using LSTM”, I attempted to simulate the movement of a bouncing ball using a Long Short-Term Memory model, wrote a summarizing paper, and presented it to the judges. I received a bronze award in the Korean Science Engineering Fair.

In “Learning to Detect Deepfakes with Facial Landmarks”, I attempted a Kaggle challenge in detecting deepfakes, where I attempted three different methods of detecting deepfakes using only the video and wrote a summarizing paper on the topic.

The last project is “Classifying High-Resolution X-Ray Body Part Images” where I attempted the classification of high-resolution images and analyzed the results in depth.",Srujam Dave,AI,Hack,Design,5-10,4,"Firstly, ACM AI project present a good opportunity to grow my skills in AI which I have great interest in. In such a volatile and constantly improving field, consistent interactions through means such as projects are necessary. By engaging in an ACM AI project, I could further delve into the field of AI with the assistance of a mentor and work through challenges in collaboration with other highly motivated and capable peers. Through practical application and experimentation, I can both deepen my understanding of the field as well as gain hands-on experience that will be valuable as I continue my studies.

Furthermore, the ACM AI project provides a great opportunity to expand my network. With the project having a mentor and being collaborative, I can meet many enthusiastic and capable individuals in the field that I will be directly working with. Also, by collaborating on the ACM AI project, I not only foster connections, but also facilitate knowledge exchange, mentorship, and exposure to diverse perspectives. Expanding my network within the field can lead to various new opportunities such as for collaboration, research partnerships, or career advancement as I continue my path in this direction.

In conclusion, I believe that the project will provide me with profound experience and opportunities that I will prove to be worthwhile.","One topic that I would be interested in is natural language processing. NLP is a subject that I find to be most impactful to my daily life through various uses such as machine translation, especially with the recent development and widespread use of chatGPT. NLP is a subject that I am quite unfamiliar with, and also one that I would like to build a strong foundation in both theory and practice. 

Another topic that I would like to work with is image, and am interested in both classifying and generative models. Image classification is one of the areas of AI that I have the most experience with, and also an area that I would like to continue to delve further into. 

I am also interested in working with audio data. I am not very familiar with audio data as well, not having used the provided audio data in my deepfake detection project, which could’ve provided me with a better result.","Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow / Keras, PyTorch, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib / Seaborn / Visualization Libraries",N/A,"The most recent project I have done was on simulating optimizers which I did over the recent spring break. This was an extension of the extended essay that I wrote in high school for International Baccalaureate (IB), around the summer of 2022. The research essay compares three different optimizers (AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam) on both their theoretical and practical components. 

Following up on this, I started a project to attempt simulating some of the most commonly used optimizers from scratch in Python, only using NumPy, random, and matplotlib libraries. I made everything from polynomial objects that will act as the loss function to the optimizers, which were gradient descent, adaptive gradient descent (AdaGrad), root mean square propagation (RMSProp), adaptive learning rate method (AdaDelta), and adaptive moment estimation (Adam). The project was fully done by me, implementing the algorithm of each optimizer through academic papers and blogs, and using the default hyperparameter from Keras documentation. While the code itself is not too complex, the aim of this project was for me to fully grasp the intuition of each optimizer and understand why they excel at certain aspects and lack in others.

I previously took programming courses, which has given me a solid foundation. However, I want to enhance my skills by challenging myself to complete elaborate projects. I would especially like to work on a project managing large scale data sets, which I can process, clean, and transform. Additionally, I want to cultivate my skills in Python by programming with machine learning algorithms. I would like to learn deep learning concepts and frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, in order to get more machine learning experience. I think it would also be beneficial to learn how to use OpenCV because there was only a small section on libraries in my Python class and I still feel unfamiliar with them, so I would love to practice more.","During winter quarter, I worked on a project for the Design Co Studio, and my group consisted of 3 people. Every Thursday we would attend the scheduled lecture time, and each week we would meet up twice outside of the lecture. During each meeting we would schedule our next meetings at a time where everyone was free. This allowed us to have a very flexible schedule. We communicated a lot through Instagram messages in order to make sure we each remembered about the meeting times and to ensure we showed up on time. I think we did an effective job scheduling meeting because we were able to meet twice 7 weeks out of 10. We were also very understanding about each other's schedules, for example, when everyone was extremely busy around finals week, we only met up once. Additionally, we were considerate of the weather, so on the rainy days we held our meetings on Zoom. One thing I think we could have improved was sticking to a specific meet time each week. Each week we would change the meeting times based on availability, which is very effective, but I think it would also be good to have a standard meeting time because the consistency helps build a routine as well as establish the project as a serious commitment.","Before joining Design Co Studio, I researched UX design and I learned about the design tool Figma. I looked for classes at UCSD to learn how to use it, but there were none available at this time. The first step I took to learn how to use Figma was messing around with Figma Jamboard, where I made small collages. After becoming comfortable with Jamboard, I decided to start a small project on Figma. I utilized many online resources and watched a lot of tutorials on Youtube, which helped me understand each tool and the interface. In order to practice my understanding, I decided to make a LoFi wireframe of a website idea for a club my friend was in. At first, I was having an easy time using the basic tools, but then I ran into a problem when it came to spacing. It may seem like a minute problem, but I find it to be a key component in an aesthetic design. I decided to do more research about Figma spacing tools. I learned about Figma’s grid layout, spacing presets, and alignment tools, which I utilized to make a simple, clean design. (I linked the wireframe I am talking about)","I am familiar with Python, and I think I can hold my own in a project group. Last quarter I took COGS 18: Introduction to Python Programming, and I ended that class with an A. I am very open to self learning since I self-learned Python before I took that class, so I am comfortable learning new skills online to help me contribute to the project.",,AI,,,5-10,4,"Not only would I like to build my technical skills, but I would love to gain more experience in a collaborative environment. I want to develop my collaboration, communication, and time management skills because good teamwork is necessary to be successful. I believe that ACM projects will help me attain these skills because I know that ACM works hard to create member retention, meaning that people who join the projects will be like-minded individuals who also want to build their skills, creating a thoroughly engaged team environment. As an introverted individual, I find it hard to reach out to others because of a fear of judgment, but I am trying to step out of my bubble, and I am comforted knowing that I will be surrounded by my ACM project members, who are genuinely excited to learn.  ","When I first learned about machine learning, I discovered that it optimizes and automates decision making, which increases efficiency. As an impact-driven individual, I loved the idea that I could help people complete tasks in their everyday lives more easily by creating efficient processes. In particular, I would love to work with computer vision. With image recognition abilities, we can decrease errors, improve accuracy, and enhance security. I would also like to work on projects related to Finance, such as fraud detection, credit scoring, risk management, and algorithm trading. My project at Design Co Studio was aimed at helping people improve their financial literacy, and I would love to expand my skills in this realm.

Since our team was small we each had the chance to contribute an equal amount of work throughout all steps of the design process. I collected my own individual user research by researching forums and online resources to get ideas for our project. I also found people to take our survey in order to add onto our research. Since I had previous knowledge of how to use Figma, I created our first Figma Jamboard and led my teammates through the ideation phase. Once we began to wireframe, we split up the parts to design. I completed the home page and the budget tracking page for the LoFi and HiFi design.

I'd also like to develop my programming skills in the languages I'm familiar with, as well as any other new languages if given the chance. While completing programming assignments in my coursework does strengthen my knowledge, there's restrictions when it comes to experimenting with program behavior or the types of programs you wish to develop so I feel like taking on a personal project with others will flourish my creative skills and advance my knowledge.","While taking CSE 21, we were given the opportunity to complete homework assignments in groups of 4. I formed a group with my friend, and two other students we connected with through taking the course. My friend was working a part-time job, and my other group members had other obligations as well, not to add each one of us had other classes and deadlines to consider. We weren't all available to meet in-person, so we resorted to conducting most of our meetings and interactions online. At the beginning, we only communicated through a group chat and didn't really conduct Zoom meetings as there were many schedule conflicts. I suggested to look into a website that allowed us to list out all our available times throughout the week and we were able to find some time to conduct meetings, so I think this was a helpful first start. However, there were times where some of us couldn't make it but we'd still communicate in the group chat. Looking back, I would've tried to bring it upon myself to send short summaries of what was discussed or done in the meetings we had for those that missed it, as well as making agendas before each meeting so that we maximize our productivity and we don't lose our focus. Additionally, we needed time to attend office hours whenever we were met with challenging problems, so whenever one group member attended office hours, we'd make time to discuss what we got resolved and how to approach a problem with the guidance of a TA or the professor. I believe this aspect was extremely helpful to us in the long run so that not all of us had to make time to attend office hours yet we all benefitted from it equally.","One of my hobbies that I've developed since high school is video editing. I enjoyed watching edits of my favorite TV shows and slowly garnered interest in creating video edits myself. I first started using the software Sony Vegas Pro and learned how to create visual effects and transitions through watching tutorials on YouTube. Due to the limitations of some of the features of that program, I switched over to Adobe After Effects and got introduced to graph editing. Even with YouTube videos, learning graph editing was challenging but the more I spent time messing around with different transitions and using the feature, the more proficient I was able to get and started creating very smooth transitions that complimented the videos I made. I also delved into animating photos in a 3D space which was a very exciting process but still had its challenges, same with graph editing. During this Spring break, I was dedicated to learn how to use Blender to create 3D objects. I was able to create my first ever 3D figure with the help of a YouTube tutorial, and added my own personal twists to the design. When it comes to not understanding a certain function or tool, I always try to figure it out by researching the internet if I can't receive personal help from someone.","I've strengthened my programming abilities in Java, C, Python, and Assembly through my coursework in CSE 15L, CSE 12, CSE 30, CSE 100, and CSE 101.",,AI,Hack,Design,10,3,"I want to participate in ACM AI Projects because I'm interested in learning more about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Although this coursework will help me delve deeper into the world of artificial intelligence and strengthen my skills in Python, I believe participating in this project will provide me a more personal and engaging learning experience than regular coursework. Given that the project offers an opportunity to work alongside other students with a similar interest in artificial intelligence, this will foster an environment where students can collaborate and exchange knowledge.

Navigating many social media apps, I try to compare and contrast how some applications have a better user experience than others and how this can be applied when developing one's own projects. Although aesthetics are important to keep the user pleased with the visual themes, functionality is a very important aspect of UX design. It's also important to observe and take note of what users themselves think about the design and their overall experience consistently as one builds a program. ","While taking ENG 100DR, I worked on a quarter long project with a team to design a Squarespace website that showcased promotional content to promote the need for electronic medical records (EMR) implementation in developing areas.

Working in a collaborative setting, I hope to broaden my perspective by hearing other people’s opinions as well as their thoughts when tackling an issue or during the ideation processes. In addition, I wish to receive valuable feedback and constructive criticism that allows me to both integrate them in my work and improve as a designer. Another skill I would like to foster through these projects is in visual communication, focusing on typography and colors that will create a layout that is visually appealing and accessible for the audience. Furthermore, I am interested in delving more into mockups and high-fidelity designs that will allow me to communicate my product design ideas more effectively. ","The latest team projects that I was involved in were in DesignCo Studio and Design 1. In both projects’ groups, we made an effort to work around people’s times to accommodate their schedule. Despite prioritizing flexibility, we also maintained personal accountability. In the case that someone couldn’t make it to the meeting and were absent, they were to notify us beforehand so that we could summarize the meeting to them as well as delegate them tasks. Additionally, we utilized the website When2meet to get an idea of everyone’s schedule so that we can unanimously decide on a meeting time. 

Overall, both groups have done a great job at managing our schedule, but one task that we could have improved on was efficiency and time management. For example, I noticed later on that whenever a member was absent, we would cancel meetings with the expectation that we could reschedule another meeting that week. As a result, this slowed down our progress or halted it altogether whenever we failed to hold meetings and went off schedule. To avoid this in the future, I would cut down the number of meetings a week to avoid feeling burnt out later on. In addition, I would emphasize using the group chat in order to communicate and split up tasks rather than solely relying on meeting times. ","As someone who grew up indulging in art, I tried my hand on everything I could get a hold of: drawing, painting, scrapbooking, video editing, to name a few. I have always been interested in graphic design, but never delved into it because I was intimidated. Not only was I overwhelmed with the large amount of softwares, but I also didn’t know where to start. It wasn’t until I started to experiment on Photoshop during summer. At first, it was daunting because of the many tools and functions within the program, but as I was experimenting with different shapes, fonts, and textures, I started to get used to it. Eventually, I started producing designs that I was pleased with. Even though I am far from a master, I’m very satisfied with my progress within these past few months. ","During my time in Design Co Studio, I collaborated with 4 other members to design a virtual mobile try-on app. Employing the Double Diamond design method, we first started our ideation process by brainstorming potential functions for the project. Then, we began the research process by sending out surveys that recorded user satisfaction with online shopping and virtual try-on. From the 76 responses, our group began noticing certain pain points that we wanted to address such as the lack of virtual try-on features as well as visual representation inaccuracies. Throughout the project, we got to understand our audience more through user personas and affinity diagrams in addition to learning ux research methods such as wireframing and user flows. After translating our low-fidelity design to high-fidelity through Figma, our group needs plans to showcase our final project within the next following weeks.

Looking through his videos was really helpful for me to get a grasp of the language. I also read through that youtuber's book, ""The Nature of Code"", which helped me learn a lot of things, not just for the programming language, but general programming skills as well. Codeacademy was the main tool I used for learning the other programming languages, and I also looked at way too many tutorialspoint pages for all the programming languages I was trying to learn. Khanacademy was another pretty helpful resource, and StackOverflow was an amazing tool to help learn all the edge cases of each programming language.

As a second year student, the only upper division CS course I have completed is CSE 100. I haven't taken any classes where I get to explore and build any projects/websites/apps that are more creative (such as CSE 110 or CSE 134B), and I would like to start building these types of projects. Working together on a coding project in a team of people is not something I have done before.

I have been working on my personal portfolio website (GitHub repo can be found here: https://github.com/FaZeDrug/fazedrug.github.io, and website can be found here: https://fazedrug.github.io/ ), and have been relying on YouTube tutorials and also help from ChatGPT to help build this website. I have no experience at all in website building, but doing this mini project myself taught me a lot. I had never used Git on my own until this project (the last time I worked with Git before this was CSE 15L) and I became more experienced with learning Git and also got more familiar with the GitHub website as a result (I had little understanding of how to navigate it before). I also learned a lot more about VS Code through the project! I learned how to preview markdown files, how to open the project through the command line (cd into the folder, then type $ code .. to open it).

I want to learn more things like this! I've learned so much on my own, and I am ready to learn more with others through ACM Projects. I want to help create a unique project that furthers my beginner skills as a programmer. Some specific skills I want to develop are website building, using the MERN stack, and more software engineering skills.

Up until now, I've only worked on PAs, and no other personal projects (besides the one I just mentioned). There is a concept called ""tutorial hell"" in CS, which is defined as ""a state of being stuck in a cycle of constantly consuming programming tutorials without being able to apply the knowledge in the real world and build real apps"". Although I haven't experienced this, I am afraid of not being able to build my own creative CS projects. There's always the classic CS projects like the weather app, tic tac toe game, etc, but I want to help create something that is unique and hasn't been made before, and I believe ACM Projects would help me develop those skills to create my own projects.","I am a part of the ERSP program at UCSD, where it is a year-long introductory researching opportunity for second-year undergraduates in computing where groups of students are matched to a professor's research project.

My group and I found it difficult to find a time to meet last quarter, as one person would throw out a suggested time, and the others wouldn't be able to make it. Our group decided to just make a When2Meet link and have everyone fill it out to see our availability.

We found a time that worked for everyone. This was an effective thing to do, as it saved us time from asking when a time would work for everyone over and over again.","In ERSP, my group is working on a project that incorporates data science. We used Google Colab for this project, and we used libraries such as pandas, pyLDAvis, etc.

I was tasked with generating the .csv files after filtering the data, and sometimes the library functions would give me errors. This was a task I was meant to do on my own, so I thought of how I could clear the error myself. Like many programming assignments, I would try to solve my errors in one of two ways, and I thought I could apply the same workflow to this task. I would either copy and paste the error into Google and look into the specific error on StackOverflow, or I would read up on the function's documentation.

I was able to successfully generate the .csv files in the end, after troubleshooting it on my own.","I am a basic programmer. I am really excited about building my own projects in the future (when I have more time).

I believe I could be a good fit to apply my graphic design skills to ACM Design (see next response).","I have had some graphic design experience in the past!

Although I don't have UX/UI Experience, I have graphic design experience. For almost one year, I held a position as Division News Editor through Key Club. I managed the newsletter, which was comprised of past/future events of ten schools in the division. I used Google Slides as a medium to edit my work, which albeit rudimentary for graphic design, helped me  win a selective award in which I was recognized as one of 24 applicants that won the award.

The award is called ""Distinguished Division Newsletter"", which recognizes individuals that have worked on the newsletters for their division and also uphold Key Club International's graphic standards (applicants are scored based on a rubric that scores on how well they followed the graphic standards which includes logo placement, fonts used, and artistic ability). As my district consisted of three states (California, Nevada, Hawaii), I was honored that I was recognized as 1/24 of the people who were recognized. It felt rewarding to be able to be recognized for my efforts in graphic design, as I didn't have any prior experience in it when I took on my role as Division News Editor.

As I am still learning and growing from the project I am working on, I would love to be able to learn and build my software engineering skills from actual people in this project.

The main interest I want to highlight is website development! I think web development is interesting, and I want to gain more experience in it. What interests me is the aspect of functionality and creative design coming together to form an interactive and aesthetic product. I am also interested in working with APIs!

Another idea could be a travel cost planning website, where users pick a budget and a destination and are recommended with different travel options (train, bus, plane) and amenities (hotel, hostel, AirBNB) that could help the user plan a trip they can afford! This can be combined with the next idea.

Additionally, another idea I have is a travel itinerary, where users pick a destination and date and have options for their trip. The user can be recommended landmarks, tourist attractions, museums, photo spots, hikes, places to eat. The website could also show the weather for those days and even an option to book/purchase tickets for any attractions that require it.

My prior experiences, including working on an interactive kiosk and contributing to the physical and digital aspects of various projects, have laid a solid foundation in design thinking and creative problem-solving. However, I recognize the importance of continually advancing my skills, especially in areas such as UX research, interaction design, and the use of cutting-edge design tools like Adobe XD, Sketch, and Figma.

I am keen on deepening my understanding of user-centric design principles and learning more about crafting intuitive user experiences that seamlessly blend form and function. This includes honing my ability to conduct effective user research and usability testing, which are crucial for creating products that truly resonate with users. Moreover, I'm interested in further developing my prototyping skills to efficiently iterate and refine concepts based on user feedback.","In my work on the ""Tree10"" algae-based bioreactor project, our diverse team faced significant scheduling challenges due to varying commitments and time zones. To navigate these obstacles, I advocated for the integration of project management and scheduling tools, specifically Trello for task management and Google Calendar for tracking availability and deadlines. This approach allowed us to have a clear, real-time view of each team member's responsibilities and time constraints, fostering a more coordinated effort.

Understanding the importance of communication in maintaining project momentum, I initiated weekly virtual check-in meetings. These meetings served not only as progress updates but also as forums for discussing any emerging challenges and brainstorming solutions together. This regular, structured communication helped us to realign our tasks with the project's evolving needs and adjust our individual schedules to accommodate critical milestones.

While these strategies proved effective in keeping the project on track, reflecting on the experience, I see the value in even earlier and more proactive scheduling discussions. Establishing a detailed project timeline at the outset and maintaining open lines of communication about availability could have preempted some of the scheduling conflicts we encountered. Moving forward, I aim to incorporate these insights into future team projects, ensuring an even more seamless collaboration process.","During the early stages of the ""Baja Del Sol"" solar water heater project, I realized the importance of accurate temperature monitoring and control for the system's efficiency. Although my background in cognitive neuroscience provided me with a strong foundation in research and problem-solving, I had minimal hands-on experience with hardware and embedded systems.

Faced with this challenge, I decided to independently learn how to use a Raspberry Pi as a control unit for the solar water heater. I set to understand the intricacies of Raspberry Pi, including its setup, programming, and integration with sensors and other hardware components.

I began by exploring the official Raspberry Pi documentation and engaging with the vast community of enthusiasts online. Through forums, tutorials, and trial-and-error, I gradually became better in setting up the Raspberry Pi, interfacing it with temperature sensors, and programming it to regulate the water temperature based on real-time data.

This self-taught skill was crucial for the success of the ""Baja Del Sol"" project, as it allowed for precise control over the water heating process, enhancing the system's efficiency and reliability.","My technical abilities are diverse and have been applied in various impactful projects, both academic and personal. One of the standout experiences was leading the ""Tree10"" algae-based bioreactor project. This endeavor not only required technical expertise in design and prototyping but also necessitated leadership in coordinating a multidisciplinary team. We successfully designed and built a 3D printed prototype, which was a testament to our collaborative efforts and my ability to guide the project towards its goals.

Additionally, my role in the Baja Del Sol project involved designing and implementing a solar water heating system from scratch, which included learning and utilizing new technologies such as the Raspberry Pi for system control. This project showcased my ability to quickly adapt to new technical challenges and effectively apply my learning to achieve practical solutions.

My commitment to social impact through technology is further evidenced by my initiative ""Bubbles of Hope,"" where I designed and implemented a sustainable model for distributing hygiene kits. This project combined my technical skills with my passion for creating positive societal change.

Through ACM Design projects, I see an exciting opportunity to apply and further hone my design skills in a collaborative, multidisciplinary environment, working alongside peers who share a commitment to innovation and social impact. The prospect of contributing to projects that push the boundaries of what design can achieve, especially in emerging technologies like AI, is incredibly motivating.

Moreover, I am drawn to the community and learning aspects of ACM Projects. The chance to engage with workshops, receive mentorship, and be part of a network of designers and technologists is invaluable for personal and professional growth.

I look forward to developing back and even front end skills through the ACM projects, and hopefully be able to develop projects on my own in the future. ","Recently I took a class that required a lot of group collaborations and one of our final projects required an essay and prototype. What had happened was that we realized a majority of our group would be out of town and unable to work on the project during the span of that particular weekend. So understanding that certain circumstances were out of our control, I pushed for people who were unable to work on the project during the weekend to do whatever they could for the time being until they left. In the end I decided to take the brunt of the work but I also asked for support in the form of ideas and revisions when they came back. While I definitely think there would be a better way to approach this, I still felt like this was the best option as I was willing to do a little bit more work than the rest but also had them support me in their own ways. ","Back in middle school I had a middle school robotics class that used Legos as the materials. The objective of the class was to complete objectives to score points. These objectives were like throwing a plastic ball at some bowling pins, going onto a bridge and stopping in the middle, things like that. While the programming was very simple, it was difficult in order to fully materialize the objectives without any guidance or help from the teacher. My group made it a goal to complete the bowling pin objective, but even despite it's relative easiness in comparison to the other challenges it was still difficult. In the end I was the main person attempting to code and build the robot. A lot of our prototypes failed along with my coding. I spent a majority of that quarter working on that single objective and basically failing or succeeding little by little. It wasn't until the final where I was able to complete that objective and a few others ones in order to get a passing grade in that class. In the end I sheer brute forced that class and somehow figured out a way to pass through pure persistence. ",I have very little skill level in terms of coding and projects like this.

To manage mroe efficiently, I utilized online teamwork platforms like Dingding, popular in China. These platforms allowed me to make announcements, communicate with team members, and schedule tasks using features such as team schedules and to-do checklists. I am responisble for supervising the  progress and distributed tasks among various departments within the Yearbook team, including typesetting, art design, literature, media, finance, marketing, and research. Each department had its own supervisor responsible for task assignment, based on decisions made collectively by supervisors and myself.

While this system facilitated project completion, it sometimes encountered inefficiencies. Some members failed to complete tasks on time, leading to last-minute adjustments and task reassignments. Additionally, communication delays can be common due to restrictions on internet usage during school hours, requiring multiple follow-ups to ensure messages were delivered to the right person. Reflecting on these challenges, I acknowledge the need for improvement in workflow efficiency. In addition, any suggestions for enhancing these aspects can be very helpful as I continue to utilize online office platforms for projects at university.","One personal project that stands out for me, highlighted in my resume's personal project section, involved delving into Aurora, an open-source computer aRGB keyboard controller software. This software was first introduced to me when I got a niche gaming laptop from Intel, introducing me to its capabilities for customizing keyboard lighting and additional peripherals with controllable RGB lighting. Despite the comprehensive English manuals and tutorials available on the software's GitHub repository, I noticed a lack of Chinese-language resources, particularly within the gaming laptop community I was active in. To bridge this gap, I undertook the challenge of not only comprehending the English manual but also experimenting extensively with the software's settings to create a detailed and thorough Chinese manual.

Working independently for nearly 20 days, I tried to fully explored the software's functionalities and settings, combining with my previous experience of other RGB controller software to uncover intricacies functions. Without direct access to platforms like Discord or direct communication with the developers, I relied solely on the English manual, my English  comprehension, and online resources to deepen my understanding. Drawing connections between various settings and exploring the underlying code logic embedded within the software, I gradually gained proficiency in non-coding aspects. Combining reading and insights from other open-source RGB control software and their manuals, I developed a comprehensive Chinese manual, addressing potential loopholes and further clarifying explanations for the benefit of Chinese-speaking users.

Beyond documentation, I provided live demonstrations of the software's features, accompanied by pictures and videos, to assist Chinese users in customizing their keyboard lighting. As my expertise grew, I assumed a leadership role within the community, becoming a dedicated assistant for over 400 individuals in the community seeking assistance with the software. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also reinforced my ability to independently tackle complex challenges and contribute meaningfully to a community-driven project.","Following what the prompt answered in the last question, afterward I was accepted by UCSD and went from China to the United States for undergraduate studies. I was finally able to connect with the developers in Discord servers and was granted permission to release my manual on the Discord server that connects the most enthusiastic users and developers of Aroura software around the world. I hope that this manual can be useful to help other Chinese language users in other parts of the world to access and maintain since it is free and open to anyone to read and post suggestions. In addition, I shared with the developers how some of my approaches and experience in the technical pursuit of using the software to make improvements in the English manual and the actual software as well.

While Covid-19 has immensely affected everyone, I strongly sensed that I should at least attempt to address some of the challenges that society was facing. One of the immediate ideas was recycling face masks. 

So in 12th grade, I established a business called Motebags (masks + tote bags) with two high school friends. While running the business MoteBags, one of the big issues I faced was productively producing the tote bags. Because it was only three of us and we were going through a heavy academic workload, it was difficult to make an efficient supply chain. So I suggested separating the roles each person has; we divided the roles into finance, design, and production. Furthermore, we were able to gather many volunteers who were more than willing to contribute to the environmentally sustainable idea we had going on. 

The core of this business experience was not the amount of profit we generated or how much ‘clout’ we gathered around our community; it was that we worked as a team and made significant progress in a short amount of time. If I were to lead this team again or do another project, I would prioritize separating the workload and finding a better tunnel for communication.","In this winter quarter, a team of four and I built a website that allows users to track various aspects of life such as work, health, and relationships. I was in the front-end team where I used Figma to design the pages and also utilized HTML and CSS to develop key features of the website. Before this project, I had no web development experience. To contribute to the front-end team, I had to self-learn HTML and CSS through YouTube; I first took notes on a crash course and then used the examples that were given in the video as building blocks. After getting familiar with the basic syntax, I just started coding using the trial and error method, using Google and ChatGPT when getting stuck. Although it took a long time to build one small thing because most of the process was the first time for me, I was able to produce some sort of a final product at the end of every session. 

By researching and learning the basics of HTML and CSS on my own, I think I learned at a faster pace than learning from a school course.

As such, I would love to develop this further with the guidance of an experienced mentor. Programming in a team definitely was definitely a learning experience in terms of working out the assignments of various parts of code. That’s why this quarter I would like to continue practicing communication, time management and delivery of effective solutions. 

In addition, most of my projects have been ""proof of concept"" projects where I have not had to deliver code on a weekly basis. In the project teams, especially in ACM Hack, I would like to further explore and apply my knowledge of Agile techniques as well as version control using Git to effectively work on weekly deliverables and organise code better.

I would also love to further develop my writing of ""clean code"". Within a project team, code ought to be readable for everyone in the team to allow for better debugging. Whilst this is what I strive for in individual projects, practicing it in a collaborative setting will put it to the test and will help me learn different techniques and more elegant solutions for complex problems.
","In high school I was on the programming team for the school's robotics team. There were 8 members - 5 engineers and 3 programmers and we were instructed to have regular meetings to discuss robot and program design. Unfortunately, given that we were in our final year, we had A Level exams in a few months meaning many people were busy with tests and revision sessions and could not dedicate as much time as we all wanted to.

The way I managed to schedule meetings was by firstly recognizing that not everyone would be available. As a result, the best strategy was to divide the 2 main groups into subgroups. This ensured that people who were free could meet. I made the condition that at least 2 of each team were present at such meetings to then relay back to the rest of the team.
 
This worked well but on occasion, meetings would not have 2 of each team leading to broken communication and lack of relaying. As a result, there were design conflicts and we could not meet our deadlines, simply due to lack of communication.

To improve this, I would attempt to either record each meeting via zoom or have various AI tools such as Otter.ai to summarize the meeting notes and have non-present team members review the notes and then relay back any feedback or inputs to their designated team lead. 

At times, we felt like we had unnecessary meetings because our roles within the team were not clearly defined. When we all met, a few people had nothing to contribute simply because their task was not relevant at the given time.  It would be better if in fact not everyone was present all the time because only relevant people were needed at certain meetings. This can happen effectively if people are delegated roles and those roles are clearly defined.
I would improve this with the use of a Kanban board to assign people to specific tasks and hence have clearer defined roles. The use of a ""blocking"" tab would prioritize meeting times for those whose tasks were of immediate priority.","Having taken CSE 8A in the Fall quarter, I started gaining an interest in learning more about LLMs. As such, I had an idea of creating a chatbot that would help navigate certain websites. To carry this project out, I researched various libraries and came across Langchain.

I took the initiative to read the documentation and learn fundamental concepts about the library. I furthered this by creating small projects to enhance my understanding of the functionalities of Langchain. 

Since the support for the LLMs that I was using was open source and built by members of the langchain community, there were occasional bugs and lack of compatibility. I overcame these solutions mainly through trial and error. For example, I attempted to downgrade the versions of Langchain to make them compatible for the LLMs which ended up working as a temporary fix. In addition, I reported/upvoted such issues on their github.

This process of ""learning by doing"" has allowed me to gain a deeper insight into the inner workings of Langchain and how an open source library is developed. I found this fascinating and I hope to eventually contribute to it as an open-source developer.
","I was awarded with a National Distinction award in the PERSE National Coding Challenge Final for solving programming challenges in Python.

This year in the Winter Quarter, I placed 3rd in the Women In Computing Beginner Programming Competition. 

On the high school's Jaguar Land Rover team, I had the role of Electronics Engineer where I worked with the rest of the team to incorporate the electronics design within the shell and design of the car. As an electronics engineer, I spent a lot of time learning how to program with new hardware which included new libraries in Arduino's modified C++. During the course of the preparation for the competition, I learned how to quickly pick up and read documentation effectively.

During high school, I created a web application using Python’s Flask library as well as HTML and CSS to create a user interface for a facial recognition program. While this project was an experience in doing software engineering, I would like to take this further and use the MERN stack to create more sophisticated websites.

This would allow for a supportive environment where everyone feels comfortable and inspired to learn new technologies to improve the quality of our project.

I also feel like the team would benefit from having a diverse set of people all with different learning interests such as front-end, back-end and full-stack to create a cohesive team. I find that if a team is not as diverse, the experience can feel diluted since there are too many people working on one thing.

I would also like to learn how to apply my coding knowledge. I've learned a couple programming languages and practiced writing algorithms, but have yet to actually put it into practice by creating a meaningful project, so this would be a great learning experience for me.","Though it isn't CS related, I worked at a summer camp in my junior year of high school. Many of my coworkers were high schoolers like me and often had other things going on at the time, so I've had to fill in for them on numerous occasions.

","Last quarter, I took ENG 100DR, where we worked with a non-profit organization, Saahas for a Cause, to create an educational comic regarding elder safety. Since our team was on the bigger side, there were many schedules we had to work around. To come up with a solution, we used when2meet to decide on our weekly meeting times, and if there were any additional last minute meetings needed, we would openly communicate on what days and times worked for everyone. To ensure everyone could stay up to date with possible missed meetings, we made sure to create meeting notes, which allowed people who were unable to attend to catch up.","For my winter project, as someone who was very new to Figma at the time, there was a learning curve especially regarding components and prototyping. I visually knew what I wanted to create, but I was not implementing them in an efficient manner, which made my design process take much longer than it should have. By watching YouTube videos and asking thorough questions to my mentor, I was able to improve my understanding of different features on Figma and properly utilize them and implement them in my designs.","Participating in last quarter's Winter Project has definitely taught me a lot about the overall design process and how to approach Figma as a beginner!

One of my bigger goals is to better organize my thoughts and deliver them in a more succinct manner. At the same time, I know I need to be able to adapt my explanations accordingly so that my team or audience is able to quickly understand. This is particularly important when working with people with different expertise and skill levels.
My personal Figma mastery has plenty of room to grow. While I’ve been able to develop some slide decks and wireframes, I haven’t had much experience with creating interactive prototypes. In general, I can definitely strengthen my grasp of Figma tools. For example, some of my more experienced design team mates would create visual guides and standardized components. Those elements would be implemented into the prototype files themselves. I want to use this opportunity to practice those particular Figma skills. This would allow me to become a more competent and reliable designer.
Additionally, I would love to learn how to use Adobe Creative Cloud. I think most design class projects can be completed with Figma, but tools such as Illustrator are still valuable and are widely used by various professional designers.","Last quarter, I was part of a five member design team. Everyone had different schedules, so scheduling meetings was extremely difficult. In order to ensure that the team would be able to meet and discuss each project phase, I sent out LettuceMeets to the group Slack channel at least a week in advance. Using this method, we were able to lock down meeting times early and focus on finishing our individually assigned work. However, most of these meetings had to be conducted late at night over Zoom. I quickly learned that completing project work over Zoom is a challenging task. Because I wasn’t able to see my team members’ reactions, I couldn’t gauge their levels of understanding and engagement. As a result, I had to reexplain certain ideas and prompt my team for input multiple times. In the future, I would like to set a regular in-person meeting time. This would help address issues with communication and create an environment where team members can actively focus on a project together.","One of my previous design teams created a Letterboxd extension for a class project. I wanted to use a slide deck with a theme that matched Letterboxd’s aesthetic, but I couldn’t find any templates online. As a result, I decided to create my own Letterboxd inspired slide deck. I had never created a slide deck on Figma before, but I knew that I could apply what I had always done when faced with a new challenge. I simply went through a series of trial and error. For this particular slide deck, I needed to include mock ups. I had never used mock ups in Figma before, but I started by copying and pasting some iPhone templates I found from a Figma plugin. I played around with the layers and manipulated features such as size and orientation. I quickly ran into a problem where the iPhone screen wouldn’t resize with the outer outline.

As every member of the team had a distinct schedule, it was hard for us to get together. To address this, we used LettueceMeet to find mutually available time slots. We also adopted a hybrid model of in-person and virtual meetings to accommodate everyone's situation, and provided summaries for those who were unable to attend. In the first week, we made a timeline about what we were going to achieve by certain dates. After that, we carried out our project based on this timeline with some minor adjustments throughout the process. Everyone was in charge of their own parts, and we met once a week to discuss progress and issues. We also communicated frequently on Discord to exchange ideas. In the end, we managed to complete an excellent project on time.","In our COGS 108 project, my teammates and I decided to extract our data from the General Social Survey (GSS). Nevertheless, none of us was familiar with how to obtain a dataset that fits the bill. Our specific task was to analyze the relationship between education levels and self-reported life satisfaction scores from the GSS data. To conduct this analysis, we needed to extract the relevant variables like the education level and responses to life satisfaction questions. It didn't take long before I found an excellent tool for that purpose, the GSS Data Explorer. However, I did spend a lot of time figuring about how to use it effectively. By reading introductory articles and watching relevant videos, I got a general understanding of navigating the interface and filtering variables. Nonetheless, the format of the initial data exports was not suitable for analysis. After failing a number of times, I eventually figured out the entire process: First, I selected the specific survey years I wanted data from. Then I filtered the list of variables to only include education level and the life satisfaction variables. Finally, I learned how to download the filtered dataset as an Excel workbook to import into our statistical analysis tool. This self-driven learning enabled me to properly extract the data we needed from the GSS in an appropriate format. It was a valuable experience in independently mastering a new tool.","Back in high school, I was responsible for tracking daily attendance for my entire class.

Currently, I have already been rejected twice from ACM projects. When I got denied these first two times, I was disappointed I would not be able to show what I had to offer. So, instead of sitting back and sobbing, I went to the ACM projects website and looked at the ACM AI projects to see if I could repurpose them. The one I particularly liked and decided to repurpose was  ""Classifying your MBTI personality based on your tweets."" While repurposing this project, along with learning the fundamentals of PyTorch and TensorFlow, I also learned that a basic AI project follows the steps of cleaning data, tokenizing the data, trying different featurizations, trying different classification ales, and overall training models to use on the data. 

However, I need more than repurposing an old ACM AI project. I want to work with a highly motivated team of four and a fantastic mentor to create an AI project I can call my own. Not only will this ACM project help me land a job, but it will also teach me the fundamentals I will need to become a great data scientist in the future.

Moreover, this summer, I will be doing research at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I will have to utilize these skills in AI. I believe doing an ACM AI project will grant me many skills and prepare me for my research I will be doing Hong Kong.","In February 2024, while working in the Rappel Laboratory, my team needed me to run various cardiac simulations and input and organize the data to visualize what was happening. So, naturally, I completed the task. Moreover, this data needed to be submitted that night, and all three members of our research group needed to meet up in person to run more cardiac modeling samples and relate this to the bigger picture for our research.

However, there was an issue: This was during a massive storm in San Diego, and downtown San Diego was flooding. One of the members of our three-person team lived where the floods were happening and was advised not to leave his house. 

To combat this, I and the other member of our cardiac modeling research group met up to discuss the results at Urey Hall while we called the other member of our group on a Zoom call. 

Ultimately, I definitely could have done a better job. What I would do better next time is
1. Plan a time and place to meet at least three days before
2. Check weather
3. Make sure everyone in the group is ok with that time and place
4. Wait to leave work until the last minute so we can deal with unexpected scenarios.","In the winter quarter of 2024, after getting rejected from ACM projects again, I decided to take matters into my own hands and do my project. However, I needed to figure out where to start and what to do. Then, a thought appeared: What if I repurposed a previous quarter's ACM project to prepare myself better for next quarter's ACM application cycle?

And that is EXACTLY what I did. I went to the ACM projects website, found the project ""Classifying your MBTI personality based on your tweets,"" and decided to repurpose it. However, there was an issue: I needed to learn to use PyTorch or TensorFlow.

So, I did what any motivated data science major would do: watch hours and hours of tutorials on PyTorch and TensorFlow and look up tons of documentation. As complicated and annoying as this was, it taught me many of the fundamentals regarding these two languages. Moreover, when I still didn't understand what was happening in the code, I inputted the code block into ChatGPT and asked it to explain what was going on and why it was doing that thing. ","As mentioned above, I have repurposed a previous quarter's ACM AI project, which taught me so much about what to expect while doing AI. I did the project primarily by myself. However, I did ask for help from a fantastic mentor and friend in Data Science graduate program at UCSD.

Other than that, I received fourth place in the ""Women in Code"" coding completion held at UCSD during the spring quarter as UCSD, which required extensive knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.",,AI,AI,AI,10,5,"I WANT TO LEARN THE BASIC STEPS OF AI TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT HAS REAL-WORLD USE.

In the future, I want to work at companies like OpenAI or Nvidia while working as a data scientist. I know it's a reach, but those companies have an actual impact on the world around us and have real possibilities to create positive change in the world around us.

Being a member of ACM projects will help me take the first step in getting closer to that goal.","As mentioned in my application, I repurposed the ""Classifying MBTI personality types based on Tweets"" project. When I repurposed that project, not only did I learn about how I could use AI to make a model with real-world implications, but I also learned the basic steps of an AI project, which includes cleaning the data, tokenizing the data, trying different featurization and classifications sales, and ultimately creating a reliable and accurate model to use on in and out of sample data.

So, to summarize, I would like to work on a basic AI project that uses the steps above and follows the same basic groundwork most AI projects do.","Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow / Keras, PyTorch, Matplotlib / Seaborn / Visualization Libraries, Matlab",N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,Yes,Yes,Male,Asian,Spring 2024

In my experiences in the computer/data science field, which range from taking introduction programming classes to working with friends on a new website - being able to create excites me the most. Whenever I pick up a new topic, my mindset has always been to think “how can I apply this concept to something bigger?” The ACM projects, being a longer and more structured project with peers who are just as driven as myself, offer me the chance to hone my skills as a problem solver. A lot of times, I find myself struggling to think of approaches to solve programming problems I encounter in my classes and being able to take part in a group that is collectively striving for the same goal will create eye-opening problem solving strategies and approaches to certain issues that I can’t wait to discover. 
From a technical standpoint, the ACM projects will be hugely beneficial in expanding my knowledge base and understanding. With my primary interest being in AI, my current experience with the “classical machine learning” and “deep learning” are simply thinking of them as buzzwords. The projects will allow me to go beyond the preliminary stages of simply knowing machine learning terms, and truly create a final product that encapsulates the various concepts I’ve never had experience with. I hope to get my hands on new libraries, such as TensorFlow or sci-kit learn, and set the foundation for me to go beyond what I take away from the projects. Moreover, I’m still a beginner when it comes to utilizing Git and Github and collaborating on coding projects with peers using these tools, so I hope to master this skill with its importance in real-life environments.
Overall, I’m excited to get an hands-on opportunity and create a project that tackles a problem or offers a strong solution. I hope to develop as a programmer while also maintaining the team-skills I’ve exemplified in my past experiences and take them to the next level while collaborating with my project members. 
","I was a Candidate Team Lead for the Silicon Valley Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, where I led a team of 30+ members in fundraising for blood cancer and research. This role taught me the importance of delegating and sharing tasks with my fellow leads and team members, a vital skill that I come across in every team setting. However, the nature of this role also led to plenty of roadblocks. The program ran for an 8 week period, so as a Candidate lead it was important that I stayed on top of our deadlines and ensured team members were following along with the goals we had set. This was an especially challenging task to maintain when all members were not able to join our scheduled meetings, leading to a lack of streamlined communication, and inefficiency as a whole. My initial idea to handle this was simply to send a recap of the meeting to those who were unable to attend, but this resulted in the team being divided in terms of what information they knew and what strategies for fundraising they were to implement, causing us to fall behind on our schedule. After meeting with my fellow leads, we decided to cut down on the large team meetings as our only group discussion and instead held check-ins with smaller subsections of the team, getting everyone up to speed on a more personal level. This strategy shift was effective due to information leading to action on the spot - as I was able to help members draft emails with our new fundraising pitch while the new information was being communicated. 
The experience taught me that managing a team, or simply having a role in a team will often have scheduling issues - but it is vital that the team does not let this detract from members being behind or left out. My methods were not always effective, but being able to identify and rebound from my initial fix displayed the flexibility and creativeness I possessed to actively participate and contribute to our team’s goal. 
","When it came to technology, the number one characteristic I possessed was curiosity. This was fully on display when I took a liking to cybersecurity, and infatuated myself with the different vulnerabilities that were present in a web application and how they could be applied to blockchain. 
Answers were hard to come by for me, especially when I was completely self-taught in this brand new field. Experimenting with Blockchain smart contracts illustrated this best. Issues with new code formats led me to the wildest of places, from the software’s Discord servers to internet forums that were last updated over 10 years ago. The tool I was attempting to utilize was called Kali Linux, a host for penetration testing. The nature of the problem I was attempting to solve forced me to introduce Blockchain contracts, and itnegrating the two was proving to be a challenge. After what it seemed like I was researching to oblivion, I stumbled upon the issue: I was failing to establish connections between my testing and the scripts due to not syncing my program with Geth, a Go implementation of Ethereum. Once I debugged this issue and established a connection I was able to discover the results of running faulty scripts, and come to conclusions about different vulnerabilities. My solutions when working on this project were often unorthodox, but I always stayed with them because I knew a path to the answer existed, no matter how convoluted it seemed. 
","While I believe I have encompassed a wide range of technical information, my technical skills are still developing. Obviously, there is always going to be something for me to learn and I’m extremely excited to delve deeper into different aspects of programming languages in their use for different purposes. With my current experience, I would say that I feel the most comfortable doing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. A project I completed on World Happiness was one where I took a lead in the small group that contributed, and managed the different aspects of preparing the dataset for different forms of analysis. I utilized the baseline skills that I gained in this project to effectively scrape data for a project I did related to identifying local charities. Coupled with the experience I have had in my classes at UCSD thus far, I consider this a strength of mine and hope to develop this even further. This goes for all facets of programming - and I’m truly committed to becoming more logically sound as a programmer and creating the most efficient solutions possible.

From that point on, Applying data science to real-life applications has always been one of the most fascinating things to me. Hearing from my friends that they helped design the “Just Walk Out” technology Amazon uses or created the chip used in GoPros has truly inspired me to work to a point where some of my contributions can have tangible impacts on the world around them. With the ACM AI projects, my work can do just that. 
My interests lie within the realms of data science and artificial intelligence, with a focus on machine learning within the subset of AI. The ACM AI Projects give me the opportunity to discover a form of machine learning within the grasps of a real-world implementation - something that makes me so eager to learn and contribute. If there’s one thing I always have questions about, it is machine learning. What does the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning look like in real-time code? What is the most effective training/test data split? I’m filled with curiosity in this subject, and these projects will only create more questions - but along the way I hope I discover some answers as well. Additionally, participating in the ACM AI projects will expand my technical knowledge, as I’m eager to delve into new libraries like TensorFlow through the lens of a real-world project.
Finally, I want to create a product that I’m proud and passionate about, one that would truly excite the young mind I possessed that pushed me to find myself in this field. I hope to create a foundation for my development in the vast world of AI and gain an understanding of the subject to where I can explain to my relatives that AI is not just “ChatGPT”.

","Some of the biggest machine learning concepts I have always been infatuated with are image classification, computer vision, and natural language processing. On the broader scale, I have always wished to create a project that mattered to something going on in the world. Whether that’s creating an image classifier for a health care issue or utilizing NLP to identify hate speech on Twitter - I wish to work on a project that creates a dent in a problem, or is effectively striving toward a solution. My personal interest in sports also has plenty of avenues into artificial intelligence, such as creating a system that works as a robot umpire in baseball to using classification techniques in fantasy football.

Now that it is on my radar however, I plan to utilize the workshops offered by ACM AI to further myself in the field of artificial intelligence. ","The project I’m choosing to highlight is a World Happiness Analysis, which sought to to compare and contrast the 149 different countries in a dataset and find out what different factors contribute to each country's happiness rating. From the six main attributes, social support, Log GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, generosity, perception of corruption, and freedom to make life choices, I wanted to find which feature are the most important to a country's overall happiness. In order to perform the exploratory analysis, I created new columns in the dataframe: a happiness score benchmark that was based on an average calculation, and whether each country was “over” or “below” it - allowing my group to almost “quantify” happiness. Additionally, I was able to implement various different classification models - such as KNN and SVM and examine results in a confusion matrix - reaching up to a 97% accuracy rate. My contributions to the project were varied in the steps of the data science process, but putting everything together truly helped me understand our results and come to a cohesive conclusion about our original question.

We had agreed on a time to interview him, but one day before the scheduled interview, he informed us he had to cancel. Surprised, we asked about an alternative date. He indicated his unavailability until the following month, which was when we were off for summer break. We then asked if there was any possibility of conducting the interview within the current month. After some time, he agreed to an interview over the weekend, which posed a challenge. Nevertheless, all board members joined a Zoom call to interview him. I believe we handled the situation well by exploring the possibility of rescheduling the interview to sometime in April. Had we not asked and attempted to conduct the interview over the summer, it would have been problematic, as many of our members were planning vacations. This experience highlighted the importance of persistence and the value of asking.","When I first started learning Python, I decided to create the classic game Snake. I had no prior coding knowledge, so I knew it was going to be a challenge. However, I thought that struggling through this project would help me learn the most. 

I started by first watching Python tutorials and reading some basic Python documentation. I concentrated on grasping fundamental Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and handling user input, which are essential for creating an interactive game. Once I felt confident with these basics, I transitioned to the game development phase.

Creating the Snake game required me to understand how to manipulate data structures, particularly lists, to track the snake's segments and its movement across the game grid. The game logic, including the snake's growth when eating food and the collision detection with the game boundaries or its tail, presented a set of challenges. I tackled these by breaking down the game's mechanics into smaller pieces, implementing and testing each one by one. Whenever I encountered bugs or unexpected behavior, I referred back to Python's documentation and utilized debugging strategies to resolve the issues.

Through this project, I successfully created a Snake game that runs in a terminal window. This experience was invaluable, teaching me not only about Python programming but also about the importance of problem-solving and perseverance in software development.","I built a program that encodes and decodes any four-letter word in python by mimicking a matrix in python through the use of a list. I then implemented the linear algebra ideas, like inverse matrices and determinants, through some math logic. Overall, it was a simple and fun project that combined my math and cs knowledge. ",Kinish Sathish,AI,Hack,Design,7,3,"During the summer, I completed a course focused on Artificial Intelligence, with an emphasis on machine learning. The course covered the fundamentals of neural networks, introduced key machine learning algorithms such as gradient descent, and showcased various machine learning applications. One application that particularly caught my attention was machine learning's role in autonomous vehicle technology. A video demonstration of a car's object detection system, highlighting objects with bounding boxes and identifying them with labels, sparked my curiosity. Motivated by this, I chose to develop a self-driving car for my project. This project solidified my interest in AI and began my research into more AI applications. 

I am eager to join ACM AI Projects due to the vast potential AI holds and the opportunities it presents for positive impact. The application of machine learning in healthcare, such as using it to identify cancer from images, is just one example that illustrates the transformative power of AI. This has led me to ponder the myriad of other possibilities that exist within healthcare and beyond. The realm of AI is expansive and largely uncharted, and I am excited to explore it further and uncover its capabilities.",Any AI project related to autonomous driving or maybe some predictor. ,"Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow / Keras, Scikit Learn",,"As mentioned above, I delved into the realm of autonomous vehicles by developing a self-driving car simulation with two other people. My primary contribution to this project was implementing the epsilon-greedy strategy, a crucial component in the car's decision-making process.

The core objective of our self-driving car project was to enable the vehicle to navigate through various environments intelligently and autonomously. To achieve this, we employed reinforcement learning, where the car learned optimal navigation strategies through trial and error interactions with its environment. My role was to integrate the epsilon-greedy algorithm, which is pivotal in balancing exploration and exploitation in the learning process.

I implemented this by coding the logic that dictated how the car decided whether to take a random new path or follow the most rewarding known path, based on its current understanding of the environment. This involved setting up a system to track the car's decisions and outcomes, adjusting epsilon over time to reduce random actions as the car learned more about its environment.

This project was a profound learning experience, highlighting the intricacies of AI in real-world applications. Through implementing the epsilon-greedy strategy, I gained valuable insights into how machines can learn and adapt, making calculated decisions that combine knowledge acquisition with practical application. This experience not only advanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the connection between AI algorithms and autonomous systems.",,UX Designer,Visual Designer,User Researcher,No,I'm not sure,7,"I'm interested in how the layout of websites affect users and how to make the most appealing design for applications.

This being my final quarter at UCSD, I am looking forward to strengthening my sense of community since I  am looking forward to forming strong bonds with my teammates, thanks to the extensive time we spend working together. Team projects not only sharpen my design skills but also provide an opportunity to practice my interpersonal skills such as teamwork.

Regarding the project itself, I am eager to expand and showcase my creativity. While mastering the design process took some time, considering that I am new to this field, I now feel ready to explore new creative horizons and challenge both myself and my teammates to make something truly unique and impactful. One aspect of design that I have been particularly drawn to is user research and analysis. In the past, I've mainly focused on UI such as visual design and prototyping; but now I would like to delve deeper into human-centered design and discover innovative ways to uncover genuine human needs. 

Drawing from my marketing and business background, I am very interested in exploring new ideas in the topics of social computing and innovation, so I am looking for a team that is just as interested in working on a purposeful project. I believe that strengthening these skills, alongside my affinity for user research, will undoubtedly allow me to leverage my strengths more effectively.
","Two of my strongest leadership skills are communication and adaptability. These qualities have served me in team projects because when schedules do not align, someone has to step up and be the person to make sure that the team is on the same page. In the past, I have taken on the responsibility of delegating work because I am disciplined and accountable myself to keep everyone on track and help steer things forward. 

First and foremost, I think that setting together ground expectations from the beginning is crucial because it can help ease future conflicts and misunderstandings that can negatively affect the people working together. My previous experience in design projects have taught me how to communicate and delegate work because usually we work on our own time. However, having that foundation is important because as a team it is still necessary to work together. Additionally, I have also learned the importance of meeting deadlines and being a responsible team member. Having these values clear is very important because meeting deadlines are important to avoid falling behind and creating additional stress in the group. I believe that I have made a difference in my precious teams by helping plan team meetings and holding people accountable for attending. I also like to use Google services and Notion to keep track of who's attending the meetings and take notes to keep others up to par with the group. These skills along with the technology tools make me feel confident about being able to work around scheduling. ","Last spring, I decided to add a new major in Cogsci Design and Interaction after learning more about the major and seeing how the classes related to my interests. Having to complete the major in one year has been challenging forcing me to take 5-6 classes a quarter (including community college) while also getting involved on campus and participating in peer projects to learn and further develop my skills. Despite discouraging and difficult times, I have been very proactive about my learning and have learned Figma by myself. Many times I have felt behind compared to my peers who have been in the major for longer, but that hasn't stopped me from teaching myself how to prototype, animate, and  wireframe through practice and youtube videos. Since I come from a research and analysis heavy background, the technical skills have been the most difficult, but being able to get those down will propel me towards a more creative and non-restrictive direction. ","I am fairly new to design; however, I have been working on many design projects in and out of the class, including Design CO Studio which I am currently wrapping up, where I have furthered my wireframing and prototyping expertise. Additionally, my abilities strongly revolve around marketing and communications, having my own Ted Talk and clothing business in the past which reflect my strengths in storytelling and business ventures making me a well-rounded person and offering a different perspective to the design community.

I know that ACM in particular has a large community of people in computing and design majors. I am looking to be a part of ACM and meet new people as this is my last quarter at UCSD. Also, in contrast to Design clubs on campus, I know that ACM offers a much more diversity and welcomes students from different avenues, skills, and career interests so I am looking forward to the new people that I will meet and work with!","I have worked on a couple design projects in the past, most notably Design Co's Level-Up and Studio. In DCO's summer internship Level-Up, I worked with a team of other designers to revamp a website for the International Bipolar Foundation. Although my main task was to work on the content, I assisted with the research, branding, and prototyping of the project, giving me my first hand-on experience UX/UI design. Currently, I am wrapping up Studio where I have taken on a role of a UI Designer focusing on all of the visual and aesthetic experience of the project. Last quarter, I also took COGS 123-Social Computing where we created a prototype for a home coordination app and website portfolio to showcase our design process and final deliverables. 

 Throughout my time at school I have also participated in Designathons, panels, and workshops that have aided me in learning more about design. ","Although I am not the most savvy or competitive applicant in design, I can assure you that my work ethic is very strong and I am looking to participate at this point in my life because I am ready to take the next step. Since honing down the fundamentals of design took some time, I am looking forward with excitement to unleash my creativity and explore new ideas that I have with a group of like-minded and passionate people.

I additionally would like to develop my problem-solving and innovation skills.","In one of my classes, I worked in a group project where we decided to split up the work to do on our own. The grade we received for the first checkpoint submission was pretty bad, and I realized we needed better communication so that we were on the same page. Thus, I created a when-2-meet for us to meet in person so that we could discuss and work on the project together in real time to avoid any confusion and allow for easier exchange of ideas. We received a much better grade for the second checkpoint submission. For the final submission however, it was difficult finding a time where everyone could meet in person at the same time as it was approaching finals week. Therefore, I figured out the most popular times people were available and suggested that those who could make one time join a zoom together, and the rest work together during the other time. That way, we were still working together. Lastly, I facilitated active communication through the group chat to ensure everyone's ideas were still being heard and we were on the same page.","As I was reviewing my dsc10 class over the summer, I noticed we would plot charts/graphs when learning univariate/bivariate analysis, but the focus was more on data analysis and the code for corresponding plots was often given and not something we had to learn. I realized visualizations was just something supplemental in that class, so I didn't get to learn about it in depth. Therefore, I searched up documentation in order to really understand how the code to plot graphs really worked. From there, I found several articles and YouTube videos and learned different visualization libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. I then was able to create the plots from lectures on my own through different libraries.","My technical abilities don't really extend beyond classes yet (I've taken dsc courses up to dsc106), but I'm eager to learn more!",,AI,,,5-8,4,"I’d love to participate in ACM AI Projects to gain experience in creating AI projects in an inclusive and supportive environment.

I’m also excited to collaborate with driven and talented peers to work on real-world AI applications, as not only am I eager to embrace being a part of the dynamic ACM community, but I’m also eager to learn from different backgrounds and perspectives. Overall, I see ACM AI Projects as a valuable learning experience in both technical aspects of AI and from peers, as well as a valuable opportunity to meaningfully contribute to projects that have tangible impacts.","I haven't had much experience/exposure to deep learning, so that is something I'd love to learn about and work on. As for machine learning, I've had some experience, and I think it'd be cool to develop projects that are related to social issues and could be useful, such as climate disaster awareness and prediction or determining amount of food to buy so less food is wasted.","Numpy, Pandas, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib / Seaborn / Visualization Libraries, Matlab",I've attended some AI workshops and reviewed past workshop slides. ,"In my data visualization class, I worked with a partner on a project where we had to create a ""scrollytelling"" website.

","When I was on board for Red Cross, it was difficult to get everyone to meet at the same place and time to discuss future plans and events.  Another problem was some members weren’t as responsive due to classes and work. To resolve this, we utilized When2meet to check everyone's availability and scheduled a date and time when most people can make it and found it effective to reach out to members individually to remind them to fill out the When2meet and ask if they can make it at a certain time. For those who couldn’t make the meeting, it was important for me to make sure they were filled in and their opinions were included. 
","One of my goals for 2024 was I wanted to learn the design tool Figma, because I was interested in the fields of UI/UX design. I started self learning through first exploring Figma’s interface, watching youtube tutorials and tiktoks.

There were a lot of problems around distribution of workload and scheduling a discussion or a work session among all of us. We ended up not having a session where we brainstorm and work together and instead we all just shared our ideas in our chat and did the work by communicating solely through texting. In the end, I believe we could've done much more and I do not think our procedure was best for our productivity and the quality for our end product. I think the issue was that we didn't have a lot of passion around our projects and if I were to have done that again, I would have scheduled a collective brainstorming or work session much further in advance and been more organized around our entire process.

Initially, I just kept doing the lessons to show my dad that I was learning but after a few months, I started to develop a real interest and passion in coding as I realized that it was behind all of the gadgets and technology we use and it can be utilized as a creative outlet to make any simple cool game that I wanted to at the time. After a couple of months of casually doing the course and learning ruby, I coded up tic tac toe without looking up a video or a tutorial and proudly showed it to my dad. Growing up through my teens, I then also taught myself python, java, html and a little bit of javascript through several online sources mainly YouTube,  stack overflow and many other sites.
